stocks,"r/Stocks Daily Discussion & Technicals Tuesday - Dec 03, 2024","This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on technical analysis (TA), but if TA is not your thing then just ignore the theme.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

stocks,Tesla CEO Elon Musk loses bid to get $56 billion pay package reinstated,"A Delaware judge ruled on Monday that Tesla, CEO Elon Musk still is not entitled to receive a $56 billion compensation package despite shareholders of the electric vehicle company voting to reinstate it.The ruling by the judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Court of Chancery, follows her January decision that called the pay package excessive and rescinded it, surprising investors, and cast uncertainty over Musk's future at the world's most valuable carmaker.

Tesla has said in court filings that the judge should recognize a subsequent June vote by its shareholders in favor of the pay package for Musk, the company's driving force who is responsible for many of its advances, and reinstate his compensation.McCormick also ordered Tesla to pay the attorneys who brought the case $345 million, well short of the billions they initially requested.

stocks,Super Micro Computer pops 15% after special committee finds no ‘evidence of misconduct’,"Super Micro Computer surged more than 14% after a special committee ruled that it found “no evidence of misconduct” at the embattled AI server maker, and appointed a new chief accounting officer.

“The evidence reviewed by the Special Committee did not raise any substantial concerns about the integrity of Supermicro’s senior management or Audit Committee, or their commitment to ensuring that the Company’s financial statements are materially accurate,” the company said in a release.

Super Micro said it’s also currently searching for a new chief financial officer, and looking to fill additional financial leadership positions. The company appointed current Vice President of Finance and Corporate Controller Kenneth Cheung as its chief accounting officer.

The news from Super Micro Computer comes on the heels of a volatile year for the company. Shares sank in August after Hindenburg Research revealed a short position in the company, saying that it found “fresh evidence of accounting manipulation” and the company delayed the release of its annual filing.

Those troubles continued, with Ernst & Young resigning as the company’s auditor in October due to concerns about the board’s governance and independence. Shares are up about 30% this year, after giving back much of its rally. Last month, the company averted a potential delisting from the Nasdaq following its monster plunge.

Among the findings, the committee ruled that the conclusions reached by Ernst & Young in its resignation were “not supported by the facts” and that the firm’s audit committee exhibited “appropriate independence and generally provided proper oversight.”

The special committee consisted of Super Micro’s board, counsel from Cooley LLP and a team from forensic accounting firm Secretariat Advisors.

stocks,GM to sell stake in battery cell plant to joint venture partner for roughly $1 billion,"General Motors plans to sell its stake in a $2.6 billion electric vehicle battery cell plant in Michigan to its joint venture partner LG Energy Solution, the automaker announced Monday.

The Detroit carmaker said it expects to recoup its investment in the facility, which a source familiar with the plans said is anticipated to be roughly $1 billion. The sale is part of a non-binding agreement between the two companies that’s anticipated to close during the first quarter of next year, GM said.

The nearly completed, 2.8 million-square-foot plant in Lansing, Michigan, was expected to be the third battery cell facility of the joint venture, known as Ultium Cells LLC, following plants in Ohio and Tennessee that have already opened and are operational.

The Lansing plant was announced in January 2022, and the two companies first announced their joint venture five years ago.

GM’s move comes as the automaker attempts to right-size production of electric vehicles and confronts slower-than-expected consumer demand. It also comes amid uncertainty regarding federal incentives for manufacturing and purchasing EVs in the U.S. under President-elect Donald Trump.

The automaker said the sale does not impact its overall ownership stake in the joint venture or its future plans for a separate joint venture plant with LGES rival Samsung SDI.

“We believe we have the right cell and manufacturing capabilities in place to grow with the EV market in a capital efficient manner,” GM CFO Paul Jacobson said in a release. “When completed, this transaction will also help LG Energy Solution meet demand by leveraging capacity that’s nearly ready to come online and it will make GM even more efficient.” 

GM said the South Korean battery supplier will have immediate access to the Lansing facility to begin installation of equipment. The plant, which currently employs nearly 100 people, was expected to begin operating by the end of this year.

Separate from the sale of its stake in the Lansing facility, GM on Monday announced it will extend a 14-year battery technology partnership with LGES to include the development of an emerging type of battery cell called prismatic cells.

Prismatic cells are a flat, rectangular shape with a rigid enclosure, which allows for space-efficient packaging within battery modules and packs. GM said the cells are expected to reduce EV weights and costs, while simplifying manufacturing by reducing the number of modules and mechanical components.

“We’re focused on optimizing our battery technology by developing the right battery chemistries and form factors to improve EV performance, enhance safety, and reduce costs. By extending our partnership with LG Energy Solution, we’re taking an important step towards these goals,” Kurt Kelty, GM vice president of battery cell and pack, said in a release.

GM had previously said it planned to expand its battery cell technologies from its flat “Ultium” pouches to include other forms such as prismatic cells.

Today the company is down again because Citi bank downgraded its rating on NU to a sell.

Why do people care that Citi bank downgraded to a sell? It’s literally a bank that could potentially have to rival NU soon if they break into USA markets. Citi bank is just worried about a rapidly growing, amazing company.

If anything, the downgrade should be seen as a good sign. It shows that american banks like Citi are starting to feel a bit of pressure from how fast NU has been able to expand its user base.

stocks,Is anyone else a little concerned about this market jump up?,"Listen, I get that it seems like clear skies and rainbows, and I’m not really a “bearish” type investor, but sometimes I find it good practice to sit back for a moment and just reevaluate the current situation we’re in.

I’ll give an example that pertains to me. I’m currently invested in Sofi, PLTR, and RKLB, so this has been an incredible year for me. But looking back, it’s starting to really feel like total and utter exuberance again like 2021. YouTube videos and subreddits have been saying over and over how this is only the beginning and we’re going to be at 500 next year. That’s exactly the type of shit that was said in 2021 right before every small cap stock tanked like 70%. 

I’m not saying it’s a time to sell, I would personally prescribe to the “it’s time to slow down on how much I invest” currently. Buying RKlb at 27$ or PLTR at 66$ is not the same opportunity as in the 4-7$ range as it used to be. It seems very difficult to find any good deals, considering literally almost every sector in the stock market is just going up vertically. And just remember, just it is a great company doesn’t always mean it’s currently a good price to buy it. Sometimes it’s good to take the foot off the breaks when stocks going up 300%+ in one year.

stocks,Does AVGO is rise count as a gift?,"Since October 2024, Broadcom has underperformed many of its technology peers as investors have rebalanced their allocations to the semiconductor sector.

Despite the recent relative weakness, Broadcom has remained in line with the S&P 500, demonstrating stability.

Broadcom expects AI revenue to reach $12 billion in fiscal 2024, accounting for less than 25% of total revenue.

Custom AI chips are at the core of Broadcom is AI revenues, accounting for up to two-thirds of the total, driven primarily through partnerships with hyperscalers such as Microsoft, AWS, and Google.

Customized chips are expected to play a more important role over the next five years, helping customers address AI cluster scaling and cost challenges.

Broadcom is leadership in the networking market could be challenged by NVIDIA, which is capturing the market with more competitive networking solutions.

Broadcom is growth in AI, while promising, is still a low percentage of overall revenue from AI.

Weakness in the non-AI revenue segment could undermine the market's bullish confidence in Broadcom.

Wall Street is constructive on Broadcom, but future guidance needs to remain strong to maintain market confidence.

Broadcom is forward-looking PEG ratio of 1.69 is attractive compared to the tech sector average of 1.89.

I think attention needs to be paid to the company's execution in AI and potential headwinds in non-AI businesses.

On balance, Broadcom stock is under short-term pressure, but the long-term bullish logic remains in place for investors who are optimistic about AI growth prospects.

stocks,What do we think about IOVA?,"Firstly congrats everyone on RKLB, ACHR and LUNR gains. It was fun ride, I have to be honest I had jumped off the wagon a bit earlier but hat off to all of you that mooned! 

Also for some of you that jumped on ZETA, enjoy the good days that await. 

But let’s talk about IOVA…:

Another biopharma stock trying to solve the issues of cancer. An industry that is a Holy Grail for all pump and dumpers out here. 

But is this one different? To be honest I do not know, but that is why I am posting this. To hear other sides, other points of view. 

IOVA is currently sitting around $9. These are levels of before the this year run to $16 (what goes up must come down, when pumped and dumped). However… this company reported revenues, 90.86mil revenue to be precise. Granted, not enough to support current market cap but bear in mind it is bio industry we talk about. It takes 1 approval and it is too late.

Leadership:
CEO is there since 2016, seems like an experienced guy. Was contributor to many oncology drugs already developed and approved.

Others seem legit as well, this post is already too long… feel free to research yourself.

They also own a bit less than 12% so there is certain commitment there.  And of course the vanguard, black rock etc. are heavily involved as well. More than 87% is owned by institutions. 

Amtagvi product got approved by FDA and that is now generating certain revenue. They plan tk get approval in Canada, Europe and UK as well. 

They also work on LN-145, IOV-4001 and IOV-3001 but let’s be honest these are long shots and nothing guarantee success of these.

I know these are speculations and putting some numbers from the future is no way to go but I feel like I have to just to make this post a bit more complete.

Potential yearly revenue if approved broader and if nothing goes wrong  is 12billion (amount of people with cancer of specific type * cost of treatment) but realistic values at beginning is 1-2bill per year or even less. 

And then for all the gamblers time that with moon if other drugs get approved as well. 

Company with 90mil revenue and 80 million of debt with 2,8 billion market cap and 440 million of operating expenses. Company with future (on the moon or in the sand). Do you hate IOVA or you will become a bag holder?

He's lucky Elon is right there next to him doing the heavy lifting to make things more - efficient.

It got me wondering about the defense sector. The pentagon has failed every audit for the last several years which leads me to believe all these defense contractors are getting kick backs off the books but also their contracts might be over inflated and they taking advantage of Uncle Sam's check book because he doesn't really know what hes signing off on.

Its possible the Dept of Justice might sue them to pay back their, corrupt pricing over the years.

The other factor is Jan 20th inauguration day. Trump clearly said he's not paying a dollar more to Ukraine, so that means billions of dollars is no longer going to flow to the bottom line. Hezbollah and Israel signed a deal. So things are staring to look more peaceful. Zelensky said he might be willing to make concessions on land to make peace.

So the question is, are defense contractors overvalued?

stocks,Thoughts on buying BRB.K this month instead of DCAing into S&P?,"Does anyone have any thoughts on buying BRB.K this month as a one off instead of the usual DCA into S&P 500?

I usually allocate the same amount of money to S&P 500 every month and have done this for years. However given much the stock market is up (27% YTD), especially including the recent trump mania, I think we are due a pull back.

And the way Buffet has been selling stocks recently, so does he. However would spending the same amount this month on Berkshire Hathaway stock instead of S&P, as a one off, hedge against this risk. 

WB has the highest stock pile he’s ever had, whilst still in the market albeit much smaller. I was just thinking it as a way of further diversification - I’ll obviously keep all of my investments in the S&P but as a one off for this month was thinking it could be wise to load up on BH stock, so can receive the benefits of the business of interest from their cash holdings as well as their equity holdings. 

Do you guys think this is a reasonable thought process or just stick to the plan and keep DCAing into the S&P this month?

stocks,Fellow Canadians: What’s the Difference Between ZSP and VFV?,"I’ve been looking into Canadian ETFs and came across ZSP (BMO S&P 500 Index ETF) and VFV (Vanguard S&P 500 Index ETF). Both track the S&P 500, which is appealing to me because I want exposure to the U.S. market, but I’m trying to understand the differences between these two funds in more depth.

On the surface, they look very similar: both are Canadian-domiciled ETFs that hold U.S. equities and are traded on the TSX. They both offer exposure to the same underlying index, so their holdings should be nearly identical. However, I noticed a few potential areas where they might differ:

**MER (Management Expense Ratio)**: ZSP and VFV have slightly different MERs. Does the lower MER really make a noticeable difference over the long term, or is it more of a ""nice to have""?

**Tracking Error**: Are there any known differences in how closely these funds track the S&P 500? Are there any instances where one deviated more significantly than the other?

**Liquidity and Trading Spreads**: For someone who might not be buying or selling huge quantities, are there noticeable differences in the bid-ask spreads? Do they trade with similar liquidity, or does one tend to have an advantage?

**Currency Hedging**: From what I understand, neither of these funds is hedged to CAD. Is there any other nuance to their handling of currency that I should be aware of?

**Dividend Treatment**: Both distribute dividends, but does one reinvest them differently or handle U.S. withholding tax in a way that might make it more or less tax-efficient?

**Historical Performance**: Have you noticed any meaningful differences in performance between these two over the years? Even if minor, what could explain the difference if the index they track is identical?

Lastly, I’d love to hear what you personally use and why. Are there specific scenarios where ZSP might be better than VFV or vice versa? Is it purely a matter of brand loyalty (Vanguard vs. BMO), or are there more practical considerations?

I'm also curious about how either fits into a broader portfolio. If you’re holding one of these, are you pairing it with other U.S. exposure like QQQ, or do you lean heavily on Canadian equities like VCN for balance?

stocks,Ocean Exploration Stocks! The next big sector! ,"In my opinion, ocean exploration stocks are heavily overlooked. With only about 5% of the ocean explored, there are so many unknowns and promising possibilities. 

Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and underwater drones is an emerging technology that I have been keeping a close eye on. This technology will make things like resource exploration, climate change research, scientific research, technological advancements and marine conservation more feasible. The are key factors that will drive growth in this sector the next 5-10 years. 

Currently there are a lot of ocean exploration companies that already have solid revenue streams from oil and gas industries and underwater infrastructure like pipelines and umbilicals. I think these current revenue streams will continue to thrive. And future revenue streams are right around the corner. 

Costs of exploration have been the biggest hurdle in this sector, but as technology continues to advance, costs have been quickly dwindling, making more and more projects feasible. 

Companies that I have recently been researching are: OII and TDY. Would love to hear everyone’s thoughts on these companies, and am excited to hear about other companies you find promising in this sector. 

Side note: I believe that there is a super-intelligent species living in the ocean that we don’t know about yet. Let’s try to find them ;).

stocks,Technology and its effect on stock market average returns. Does the future hold higher average returns?,"I know, I know.......I know. NO ONE knows what the market will do other than it will go up, down or sideways.

But I feel like we live in a different world now than we did the past numerous decades. Everyone has access to investing. Right in the palm of their hands. Virtually anyone anywhere can invest in any market they wish from their phone. Historical returns are 7 percent (inflation adjusted) based on old technology, processes, access and education on finance. It is no longer the days of old where tie wearing NYSE brokers answer their rotary phones screaming about deals and brokering deals for end user. It was a whole process and really, you NEEDED someone to strike the deals for you and in most cases, suggest what funds to invest in since there was no internet to self educate or even research companies to invest in.

Nowadays with giants like Fidelity, Vanguard and others offering index funds that take all of the thought and most of the choice and a lot of the risk out of the equation. I don't need to ask a broker which SP500 fund to buy. I don't need a broker to strike deals for me. I don't even need to make a call or have a person do ANYTHING for me.

I am not a crypto investor, I am a naysayer in fact. But I cannot deny the effect that crypto has had on investing. It has done a LOT to make investing mainstream, if not even trendy. There were always hedge funds and major investors but now regular consumers are taking part and making retail a MUCH bigger player. Retail tripled almost instantly in 2020 and participation has remained high.

Almost all of the hurdles have been removed between the investor and the investment with technology. There is little to understand/learn and is done anywhere, any time for convenience. Not a fan of robinhood but apps like this have put the keys to investing directly into the end users hands.

Now that investing is automatically diversified, exceptionally well returning index funds are in the palm of everyone's hand, consider that the US stock market is the economic powerhouse of the world. Anyone anywhere for the most part can invest in US stock market. This is appealing to anyone in a lesser financial climate (Japan). Now that the wealth gluttons have their claws in every last corner of US government, I don't see them doing anything but moves to further bolster financial and economic markets. The US stock market is the harvesting field of the elite wealth gluttons.

My personal thoughts though as I said, I am aware NO ONE can predict the stock market. But it feels poised to redefine ""average returns"" and with the near future political climate.....if it doesn't get completely blown up (unlikely) I think future returns will far exceed 7 percent as long as the USA remains the economic powerhouse that it is",22,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h2ppqn/technology_and_its_effect_on_stock_market_average/,know knowi know one know market go sideways feel like live different world past numerous decade everyone access investing right palm hand virtually anyone anywhere invest market wish phone historical return percent inflation adjusted based old technology process access education finance longer day old tie wearing nyse broker answer rotary phone screaming deal brokering deal end user whole process really needed someone strike deal case suggest fund invest since internet self educate even research company invest nowadays giant like fidelity vanguard others offering index fund take thought choice lot risk equation dont need ask broker sp fund buy dont need broker strike deal dont even need make call person anything crypto investor naysayer fact cannot deny effect crypto investing done lot make investing mainstream even trendy always hedge fund major investor regular consumer taking part making retail much bigger player retail tripled almost instantly participation remained high almost hurdle removed investor investment technology little understandlearn done anywhere time convenience fan robinhood apps like put key investing directly end user hand investing automatically diversified exceptionally well returning index fund palm everyones hand consider u stock market economic powerhouse world anyone anywhere part invest u stock market appealing anyone lesser financial climate japan wealth glutton claw every last corner u government dont see anything move bolster financial economic market u stock market harvesting field elite wealth glutton personal thought though said aware one predict stock market feel poised redefine average return near future political climateif doesnt get completely blown unlikely think future return far exceed percent long usa remains economic powerhouse,0.07809361471861474,Positive
stocks,Reddit overtakes X in popularity of social media platforms in UK $RDDT,"[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/28/reddit-overtakes-x-in-popularity-of-social-media-platforms-in-uk](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/28/reddit-overtakes-x-in-popularity-of-social-media-platforms-in-uk)

Reddit, the American online discussion platform, has overtaken X to become the fifth most popular social media platform in the UK, according to the communications watchdog.

Ofcom said Reddit, where users post on discussion threads within topic-based communities, was visited by 22.9 million UK adults in May this year, compared with 22.1 million on X.

The figures make Reddit the fastest-growing large social media platform in the UK and represent a growth of 47% on the same period in 2023. The leap took Reddit above LinkedIn and X into fifth place on the table of UK social media platforms, which is now topped by YouTube after it overtook [Facebook](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook), reaching more than 44 million adults.

Reddit, renowned for its devoted user base who refer to one another as Redditors, appears to have been boosted by updates to Google’s search engine this year.

Farhad Divecha, the managing director of the UK-based digital marketing agency AccuraCast, said: “Google’s latest algorithm update in the first half of 2024 gave Reddit a big boost in organic search traffic. I think that has probably contributed a lot.”

Ofcom also speculated that the change may have been caused [by alterations to how third-party apps accessed its content](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/14/reddit-moderators-vow-to-continue-blackout-in-api-access-fees-row), forcing users of those apps to switch to the Reddit site. The watchdog also flagged publicity around Reddit’s stock market flotation in March this year.

The popularity of X also fell over the same period, according to Ofcom, with its reach falling by 8% since May last year. X has been criticised over content moderation standards since its [takeover by Elon Musk in 2022](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/28/elon-musk-twitter-hate-speech-concerns-stock-exchange-deal) but it has also faced competition since July 2023 from Threads, a rival to X [launched by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/06/meta-launches-twitter-rival-threads-in-100-countries).

The Ofcom figures featured in the watchdog’s annual report into the nation’s digital habits, which revealed that four out of 10 UK adults say they have encountered misinformation or deepfakes, with the majority of those cases occurring online.

The misinformation survey, based on a poll of more than 4,000 UK adults, also found that three in 10 adults believe there is a single group of people who control the world together, with the same number believing there is “significant evidence” of electoral fraud in the UK.

The regulator also found that one-third of UK adults are not confident in judging whether an image or a piece of audio or video has been created by artificial intelligence.",1051,165,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h1x2aj/reddit_overtakes_x_in_popularity_of_social_media/,reddit american online discussion platform overtaken x become fifth popular social medium platform uk according communication watchdog ofcom said reddit user post discussion thread within topicbased community visited million uk adult may year compared million x figure make reddit fastestgrowing large social medium platform uk represent growth period leap took reddit linkedin x fifth place table uk social medium platform topped youtube overtook facebook reaching million adult reddit renowned devoted user base refer one another redditors appears boosted update google search engine year farhad divecha managing director ukbased digital marketing agency accuracast said google latest algorithm update first half gave reddit big boost organic search traffic think probably contributed lot ofcom also speculated change may caused alteration thirdparty apps accessed content forcing user apps switch reddit site watchdog also flagged publicity around reddits stock market flotation march year popularity x also fell period according ofcom reach falling since may last year x criticised content moderation standard since takeover elon musk also faced competition since july thread rival x launched mark zuckerbergs meta ofcom figure featured watchdog annual report nation digital habit revealed four uk adult say encountered misinformation deepfakes majority case occurring online misinformation survey based poll uk adult also found three adult believe single group people control world together number believing significant evidence electoral fraud uk regulator also found onethird uk adult confident judging whether image piece audio video created artificial intelligence,0.060047619047619044,Positive

stocks,The evolution of an investor - Which level are you?,"I believe there’s a common journey (or evaluation) of an investor. We all start by knowing absolutely nothing about analyzing companies or investing in general, but we get better over time, as we accumulate knowledge and experience.

**Level 1: The Noob**

At this level, the focus is solely on the **share price and its past performance**. So, when the share price goes down from $100 to $30, the noob investor would conclude that now, the stock is cheap and buying is the right thing to do. Of course, this doesn’t have to be the case. In fact, public companies that went bankrupt went on exactly this trajectory. There are plenty of reasons why the share price could collapse, and this decline could be justified. However, the noob investor isn’t aware that there are many questions that one should ask.

In addition, at this level, there’s a **tendency to follow the crowd and the opinion of others**, which is often times a really bad idea. However, without any knowledge and experience, the opinions of others oftentimes sound logical and smart.

**Level 2: The Enthusiast**

The enthusiast has heard that **there’s more to investing than just the share price**. You’ve started exploring financial statements, and you’re learning the basics of accounting. **For the first time, the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement start making sense**. I’m sure everyone can recall that time when you could read the financial statements and understand what they meant. It comes with a confidence boost, and it is normal to think “*Ah, I’ve got this investing thing figured out. It’s easy!*”

The catch is – even though it feels like a superpower, this is still the beginning. Financial statements provide information about what happened, not what will happen. Understanding them is useful, but not enough to be a great investor.

But at least now, you can actually challenge some of the opinions of others.

**Level 3: The Seeker**

This is where one is moving beyond the basics. Now you’ve learned that there are **various valuation techniques**, that allow you to figure out what a company is worth. It gets exciting! This is where you get introduced to the EBITDA and P/E multiples, relative valuation, dividend discount model, and DCF. All of these can be powerful tools, and they’re one piece of the puzzle to understand if a company is undervalued or not. At some point, you will likely stick with one or two models that work best for you.

But here’s the problem. Having the tools isn’t the same as knowing how to use them. At this stage, it is common to have fancy spreadsheets with inputs that aren’t supported in any meaningful way other than historical financial data. Basically, **garbage in – garbage out**. You might not be aware of the disadvantages that come with the various models and fall into some of the common traps.

However, it doesn’t feel that way. When you spend hours gathering data and filling in your inputs, **it feels like a new superpower**, because in the end, there is an output. You have estimated the value of a company, and now you can compare that with the market price.

But, if your assumptions about growth rates, the discount rate, or margins are significantly off, your valuation is meaningless. In fact, there’s a chance it harms you more than it helps you.

By the way, everything that I’ve mentioned until now can be 100% automated. So, up until this level, you have no advantage over a relatively simple algorithm.

**Level 4: The Thinker**

At this point, you understand how important the inputs are.

Therefore, the focus shifts a bit more towards **understanding the industry, and the broader environment**, and asking the right questions so that the input is more solid.

For example, if you are analyzing a car company, you might want to understand if there’s a trend regarding EVs, if there are any regulatory changes that will impact your margins, if the company needs to invest more to expand its capacity, etc.

This is when **research becomes your best friend**. You’re no longer just looking at the company in isolation—you’re connecting the dots between the company, its competitors, and the broader environment. Storytelling also becomes a part of your process, as now you’re not just crunching numbers—you’re building a narrative about the company’s future.

**Level 5: The Pro**

This is the pinnacle of investing and where intangibles come into play.

I don’t mean goodwill and patents. I mean **the management team and the company’s culture**. The key questions here are:

* Is the management trustworthy?
* What is its track record?
* What is its vision?
* Is there a culture that can survive tough times?

Culture is an often-overlooked factor in investing, but it’s incredibly important. As the saying goes, 'Culture eats strategy for breakfast.' A company with a strong culture can attract and retain top talent which is a must for being a great company.

What I find interesting is, that if you are to invest in a private company, you’d get to level 5 sooner than if you invest in public companies.

Here’s an example. Imagine someone walks up to you, and offers you to invest $10k in his company, and in exchange, you’ll have 10% of it. The first question that you’ll have is: Who is this person? If the person in question was someone you know for bad behavior, misleading friends and family, and many failed ventures, you probably have your answer already, and the idea is irrelevant.

However, if it was someone you knew who has integrity and many successful ventures, then you’d probably continue the conversation by asking questions about the idea itself. Your goal would be to understand the business, whether it can survive in the environment, and what return can you expect from it.

I hope you enjoyed this post and wish you great success on your investing journey! Do you recognize these levels in your own progression?

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

stocks,I think bird flu risk is being underestimated by the market. Long on $MRNA,"So far H5N1 has been slowly making it’s way from chickens to cows (around the middle of 2024) and now pigs in Oregon (within the last couple weeks). There have been a few mild human cases, basically all in farm workers working closely with infected animals. Although there was at least one case recently where they had no idea where the patient got infected from.

Normally, CDC will be tracking all this and keeping tabs on isolation of infected communities/individuals. This flu seems to be most prevalent in the US than other countries so far, and we have much more transparency and observability than China. So my risk assessment for this has been pretty low until Trump got elected.

But Trump has been making it very very clear that he’s going to pull every stop to deport undocumented migrants. Most of the people working in shitty conditions in farms are…undocumented. Undocumented workers are normally able to access some level of public services like healthcare, but this is about to get completely shut down by the Trump admin. And these farm workers are about to get shoved into concentrated compartments with really poor hygiene conditions, and it’s going to take a long time for them to actually get processed and deported. Many will run and hide, and that will also end up hiding how many people are actually infected and spreading the disease.

I think most people are expecting the Trump admin, especially under RFK Jr.'s health dept, to reduce spending on vaccines. But I think at a certain point, the rhetoric is bound to change, as more and more people get bird flu. After all, Operation Warp Speed was under the last Trump administration as well.

Moderna was given $176 million in July by the HHS to develop an mRNA bird flu vaccine. There already exists a bird flu vaccine made by CSL Seqirus, but I would imagine that the Trump administration will want to call upon a well-known American company to manufacture ""America first"" vaccines.

$MRNA has been down for many months, as the COVID hype worn down, but they [recently announced](https://www.biospace.com/business/moderna-slashes-r-d-budget-by-1-1b-eyes-10-approvals-through-2027) that they are reducing R&D expenses and focusing on 10 approvals by 2027.

stocks,If you could only buy one stock now what would it be,"
I have $2000 to invest. I’m stupid when it comes to stocks and just listen to random strangers on Reddit. Only did it a couple times and 5x my money both times. Now I’m here again. Give me one stock that you would go all in on today and sell within 1-3 years.

stocks,PayPal: A Path Back to Its Historical Strength and Growth Potential,"PayPal, once a darling of the fintech space, has seen its valuation contract significantly over the past few years. With its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio currently hovering around 20, the stock is far below its historical average of 43. A return to that average, driven by projected earnings of $5.71 per share by 2025, would imply a stock price north of $246—an opportunity that many investors might be overlooking. But for PayPal to reclaim its historical valuation, much must fall into place.

The foundation of PayPal’s future lies in its strategic initiatives, beginning with the integration of its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD). Introduced in 2023, PYUSD is more than just another digital currency; it is PayPal’s bridge to the future of blockchain-powered commerce. Unlike many failed stablecoin experiments, PYUSD is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits and Treasuries, giving it the stability and trustworthiness needed to thrive. The potential for PYUSD to facilitate global cross-border payments and power decentralized finance (DeFi) applications is immense. PayPal’s ability to capitalize on this innovation could redefine its relevance in the financial ecosystem.

Beyond cryptocurrency, PayPal is making waves with a growing advertising business that has largely flown under the radar. By leveraging its immense trove of transactional data from over 400 million active users, the company is building a platform that allows merchants to create highly targeted and effective marketing campaigns. This advertising arm, though still in its early stages, has the potential to generate billions in annual revenue. Even modest success here could have a significant impact on PayPal’s top line, creating another compelling growth driver.

Innovation has always been at the heart of PayPal’s strategy, and recent developments like the Fastlane checkout system showcase its commitment to staying ahead. This one-click guest checkout feature, paired with partnerships with major platforms like Shopify and Fiserv, enhances the company’s offerings for merchants and consumers alike. Meanwhile, initiatives like the CashPass rewards program deepen user engagement and loyalty, ensuring that PayPal remains a go-to solution for everyday transactions.

Leadership will play a critical role in PayPal’s resurgence, and newly appointed CEO Alex Chriss appears well-suited for the task. With a proven track record at Intuit, Chriss has demonstrated his ability to foster innovation and deliver results. His focus on empowering small businesses aligns perfectly with PayPal’s strengths and provides a roadmap for future growth.

But the journey back to a P/E of 43 will require more than just strategic initiatives and innovation. PayPal needs to rebuild investor confidence. The company must consistently deliver strong earnings, improve operational efficiencies, and effectively communicate its vision to the market. Transparent updates on key growth areas—such as PYUSD adoption, advertising revenue, and merchant partnerships—will be crucial in shaping the market’s perception of PayPal’s potential.

A return to PayPal’s historical valuation isn’t just about numbers; it’s about the story the company tells and the trust it rebuilds with investors. If PayPal can execute on its strategy, the potential reward is not just a higher stock price but a reaffirmation of its position as a leader in the fintech space. For those willing to look beyond the current market sentiment, PayPal’s path to $246 offers a compelling narrative of transformation, growth, and untapped opportunity.

TL;DR: PayPal is undervalued at a P/E of 20 compared to its historical average of 43. To return to its peak valuation, it must capitalize on its stablecoin (PYUSD), grow its new advertising business, and leverage innovative products like Fastlane Checkout. Under CEO Alex Chriss, with strategic execution and strong earnings, PayPal could see a stock price of $246 by 2025, reaffirming its leadership in fintech.

stocks,Microsoft faces wide-ranging U.S. antitrust probe,"The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has opened a broad antitrust investigation into Microsoft, including of its software licensing and cloud computing businesses, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

The probe was approved by FTC Chair Lina Khan ahead of her likely departure in January. The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, and the expectation he will appoint a fellow Republican with a softer approach toward business, leaves the outcome of the investigation up in the air.  
  
The FTC is examining allegations the software giant is potentially abusing its market power in productivity software by imposing punitive licensing terms to prevent customers from moving their data from its Azure cloud service to other competitive platforms, sources confirmed earlier this month.  
  
The FTC is also looking at practices related to cybersecurity and artificial intelligence products, the source said on Wednesday.

Microsoft declined to comment on Wednesday.  
  
The FTC fielded complaints about Microsoft last year as it examined the cloud computing market.

NetChoice, a lobbying group that represents online companies including Amazon and Google, which compete with Microsoft in cloud computing, criticized Microsoft’s licensing policies, and its integration of AI tools into its Office and Outlook.

“Given that Microsoft is the world’s largest software company, dominating in productivity and operating systems software, the scale and consequences of its licensing decisions are extraordinary,” the group said.  
The FTC has demanded a broad range of detailed information from Microsoft, Bloomberg reported earlier on Wednesday.  
  
Until now, Microsoft has been somewhat of an exception to U.S. antitrust regulators’ recent campaign against allegedly anticompetitive practices at Big Tech companies.  
  
Facebook owner Meta Platforms, Apple, and Amazon.com Inc. have all been accused by the U.S. of unlawfully maintaining monopolies.  
  
Alphabet’s Google is facing two lawsuits, including one where a judge found it unlawfully thwarted competition among online search engines.  
  
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified at Google’s trial, saying the search giant was using exclusive deals with publishers to lock up content used to train artificial intelligence.  
  
It is unclear whether Trump will ease up on Big Tech, whose first administration launched several Big Tech probes. JD Vance, the incoming vice president, has expressed concern about the power the companies wield over public discourse.  
  
Still, Microsoft has benefited from Trump policies in the past.  
  
In 2019, the Pentagon awarded it a $10 billion cloud computing contract that Amazon had widely been expected to win. Amazon later alleged that Trump exerted improper pressure on military officials to steer the contract away from its Amazon Web Services unit.

stocks,Why I think UBER is a BUY,"**Personal trading context:**

I do not look at balance sheets ever. I invest in companies that are undervalued due to bad publicity and not bad product. This year when CrowdStrike dipped from $390 to $217 I immediately took a position because I knew it was because of panic and not because the company's products are losing inherent value. I did the same for Meta during the whole VR panic and Tesla earlier this year. All of which dipped and are now up by more than 100%. Stock prices are determined by emotional sentiment so analyzing balance sheets are a waste of time to me.

**About Uber:**

I don't know anything about Uber's debts or profits, but I do know they are deviously good at getting around regulations and have completely pitted customers and drivers against each other. Recently I saw a post saying how Uber is sorry that they will now only allow drivers hired by agencies to drive instead of individual contractors in some European region. Do you think Uber is *really* sorry? This sounds like the government is getting involved and constricting Uber but I'm going to tell you why these things don't even matter.

Recently in my area the government passed regulations making Uber pay a minimum of $20.88/hr. You'd assume this will cut into Uber's profits but they got around it and drivers are not actually getting any of that money. What's crazy is that they're now pocketing more money from customers due to this change. I went into detail in another post which is important for you to read to help fully comprehend my view: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gzpvrd/new\_uber\_2088\_minimum\_pay\_is\_not\_what\_you\_think/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gzpvrd/new_uber_2088_minimum_pay_is_not_what_you_think/)

After going through that link you *should* understand that on the surface it seems like drivers will benefit from a minimum pay but they're actually earning less and customers are paying more. This is where I'm dumbfounded because even though I pointed out that Uber is deceiving it's customers and charging them a bogus ""service fee"", instead of getting mad at Uber they're getting mad at me for insinuating that drivers should get paid more. I thought I was doing a good thing by informing people how the new ""service fee"" they're paying to cover the driver minimums are actually getting pocketed by Uber, but nobody seems to care and instead enjoys the fact that drivers are not getting paid more money. I've been getting posts in my feed from r/tipping recently and they're pretty much all complaints against restaurants, drivers, and overall tipping culture. I also constantly get posts from drivers complaining about customers on r/UberEatsDrivers. Customers don't want to tip and are ignorant about how the job works. They hate drivers. Drivers make less money and hate customers as a result. Both sides have been completely brain washed and pitted against each other when the real enemy is actually Uber themselves. This is amazing for investors.

I love how Uber is able to take advantage of people and cleverly get around regulations that are meant to make them less competitive to make even more money. If you really want to make conspiracies you can even go as far as saying Uber themselves wants these new regulations to pass because they know it benefits them. Customers are the product and the drivers are just disposable pawns until they can get robo taxis to drive for them. If you like A.I. this makes Uber a great alternative to buying straight NVDA or TSLA. They don't give a shit about you or me. Only revenue, but they're damn good at hiding that from their customers and drivers. I fucking love it. If you're going to spend money on Uber, spend it on shares.

stocks,Could Coinbase enter the S&P 500 in the Dec Rebalance? What do you think!,"[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) Global Inc. (COIN) has demonstrated significant growth, meeting several key benchmarks considered by the S&P 500 Index Committee. However, its performance is closely tied to the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin. This correlation is evident, as Coinbase's stock price often mirrors Bitcoin's fluctuations. For instance, during bullish Bitcoin trends, Coinbase experiences increased trading volumes and revenues, leading to higher stock valuations. Out off all the likely companies [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) is in my top 3 for inclusion this Rebalance.  
  
The forthcoming S&P 500 rebalance will indeed be indicative of the Index Committee's perspective on integrating companies like Coinbase, which are deeply embedded in the cryptocurrency sector. Inclusion of such a company would signal a significant shift towards embracing the evolving financial landscape and acknowledging the growing prominence of digital assets. Conversely, opting not to include Coinbase might suggest a more cautious approach, reflecting concerns about the inherent volatility and regulatory uncertainties associated with the crypto market. Therefore, the committee's decision will not only impact Coinbase but also serve as a broader statement on the acceptance of digital asset platforms within traditional financial indices.

[TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSDT/fiO01sTb-Dynamic-Relationship-Between-Bitcoin-and-Coinbase/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

The S&P 500 Index Committee employs specific criteria for inclusion, such as market capitalisation, liquidity, domicile, public float, and financial viability. While Coinbase may satisfy these quantitative measures, the committee also exercises qualitative judgment, considering factors like market stability and the company's role within its industry.

[Corporate Finance Institute](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/equities/sp-500-index/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Given Coinbase's substantial exposure to the volatile cryptocurrency market, the committee might deliberate on the potential risks associated with such volatility. The decision to include a company so intertwined with the crypto sector would reflect the committee's stance on the evolving financial landscape and its readiness to integrate digital asset platforms into traditional indices.

In summary, while Coinbase appears to meet the fundamental requirements for S&P 500 inclusion, its strong correlation with Bitcoin introduces considerations that the committee will likely scrutinise, balancing traditional financial principles with the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market.",1,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h1z88c/could_coinbase_enter_the_sp_500_in_the_dec/,coinbase global inc coin demonstrated significant growth meeting several key benchmark considered sp index committee however performance closely tied cryptocurrency market particularly bitcoin correlation evident coinbases stock price often mirror bitcoins fluctuation instance bullish bitcoin trend coinbase experience increased trading volume revenue leading higher stock valuation likely company coinbase top inclusion rebalance forthcoming sp rebalance indeed indicative index committee perspective integrating company like coinbase deeply embedded cryptocurrency sector inclusion company would signal significant shift towards embracing evolving financial landscape acknowledging growing prominence digital asset conversely opting include coinbase might suggest cautious approach reflecting concern inherent volatility regulatory uncertainty associated crypto market therefore committee decision impact coinbase also serve broader statement acceptance digital asset platform within traditional financial index tradingview sp index committee employ specific criterion inclusion market capitalisation liquidity domicile public float financial viability coinbase may satisfy quantitative measure committee also exercise qualitative judgment considering factor like market stability company role within industry corporate finance institute given coinbases substantial exposure volatile cryptocurrency market committee might deliberate potential risk associated volatility decision include company intertwined crypto sector would reflect committee stance evolving financial landscape readiness integrate digital asset platform traditional index summary coinbase appears meet fundamental requirement sp inclusion strong correlation bitcoin introduces consideration committee likely scrutinise balancing traditional financial principle dynamic nature cryptocurrency market,0.08103448275862067,Positive
stocks,Huge Insider Buying at Prospect Capital $PSEC,"Prospect capital's share price took a big hit last month and it was due to an audio forcing them to take a loss on investments that will bring in revenue soon. This dividend stock is way undervalued. And the insider buying lately backs up that thesis. 

  
The CEO has purchased nearly 4.2 million shares or over $20 million! he takes 0 Salary! The President has a salary of 175K and has purchase about that in shares! Every day this week I get SEC filings saying they are buying more. See for yourself:

[https://www.prospectstreet.com/investors/Docs/InsiderFilings/](https://www.prospectstreet.com/investors/Docs/InsiderFilings/)

Yesterday somebody I follow took a call from the company and told us this:

""The Chief Credit Officer at PSEC called me about 11am yesterday. Steven Stone. I was surprised it was from a cell phone. We spoke in February for about 50 mins as well. I have actually met the CEO 3x, last about 13 years ago at an annual shareholders meeting. I first attended in my 20s, was in the city. 1 thing you should know about PSEC is that it is a super defensive stock. The idea is, it is supposed to stay level, about 6, and supposed to give you near 12% in dividends, while having a steady price… We can see that has happened in this market, but that is the idea. It is always good to diversify… I had called and thought the drop off was do to their main REIT business. That business has about 70 multi family properties. Some with 100s of units. Those properties are not prime areas, they are 2^(nd)/3^(rd) tier.. They cash flow well, but on paper, they can depreciate, the asset value, prime can depreciate a lot! So this quarter the value of the REITS were written down much harder than the past, this is determined by their auditor… Every quarter there 117 investments must be appraised…. The loss and bad quarter is on 3 companies. 1 of which they finally did take a write off of near 120 million! PGX a credit repair service. The original owners took out nearly 200 million loan. When they could no longer pay the loan back, as the Govt fined and halted the business, they could not pay it… So PSEC took it over. It has a lot of upside, the margins there are high. We had spoke about this in February and had hoped that the service would be up and running. But it is still shut down, so the auditor forced them to take the loss… This is on paper! They didn’t lose the cash, the cash was loaned out. Hence the EPS will look bad.. They did earn less income because the other 2 of 3 that messed this quarter up, are failing. PSEC suspended interest payments on these 2. 1 of these holds a 180 million loan. PSEC cut the dividend and has chosen to take over these 2 businesses for a turn around. When turned they may sell the business and reap rewards.. Personally, hearing about these other 2, EH! But the credit repair is a cash cow.""

I am targeting potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. This means the potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, not the business, long-term prospects, or the people involved.

PLEASE ask specific questions and PLEASE don’t ask about earnings because I typically don’t take positions before earnings announcements. Questions like “Thoughts on \_\_\_\_\_?” or “Why isn’t \_\_\_ on the watchlist?” or something answered already will be ignored unless you add detail and your opinion.

stocks,Deep dive into Kering - From Timber to Gucci: A Legacy of Acquisitions,"**1.0 Introduction**

Let’s start with a fun fact. Kering, the company that owns brands like Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, and Alexander McQueen, started as a **timber-trading company**.

Although it started back in 1962 and operated in a different industry, its DNA and management style haven’t changed much.

As I’m writing this, its share price is **down over 70%** from its peak back in August 2021 that was elevated due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

  
**2.0 The journey from timber to luxury**

***2.1 The timber period (1962 - 1988)***

The company was founded in France by François Pinault back in 1962 with a 100,000 francs loan from the bank. The business grew rapidly by **acquiring** many failing local timber traders in France, especially in the 1980s. By 1988, it owned 180 companies and 33 factories.

***2.2 The switch from timber to retail to luxury (1988 - 2013 - present)***

In 1988, it was listed on the Paris Stock Exchange and the first transformation from timber to retail started:

* It merged with CFAO (A French distribution conglomerate)
* Acquired Conforama (French furniture retailer)
* Acquired Printemps (Department stores)
* Acquired 54% of La Redoute (French mail-order shopping retailer)
* Acquired Finac (French bookstore, multimedia, and electronics retailer)

The transformation from retail to luxury started in 1999 when it acquired 42% of **Gucci Group,** 100% of **Boucheron,** and 100% of **Yves Saint Laurent.** Today, Gucci accounts for 47% of its revenue.

François-Henri Pinault, the son of the founder François Pinault, became general manager of the company in 2003, and CEO in 2005. Under his leadership, the acquisitions in the luxury space continued.

It is important to note the divestments of their previous acquisitions (Conforama, Le Printemps, CFAO, and Fnac).

Its portfolio is quite diversified and includes:

* High-end clothing
* Footwear
* Handbags and leather goods
* Sunglasses and eyewear
* Scarves & other fashion accessories
* Jewelry
* Fragrances (due to the Creed acquisition)
* Cosmetics (in early stage)
* Watches

It is also geographically diversified:

* **APAC (excl. Japan)**: 32% of revenue
* **Western Europe**: 28% of revenue
* **North America**: 23% of revenue
* **Japan**: 8% of revenue
* **Rest of the World**: 9% of revenue

**3.0 Historical financial performance**

Its revenue increased from €15.9 billion in 2019, to €20.4 billion in 2022, and has contracted back to €18.4 billion as the demand for personal luxury goods started to decrease after the pandemic. 

Kering’s gross margin is stable at \~75%, meaning the direct costs are well controlled.

However, its operating margin is down below 20% (vs. 29% back in 2019). The explanation is simple.

**Reducing operating expenses is an incredibly tough job.**

When there’s less traffic (and subsequently less sales) in the physical stores, the operating expenses remain the same. The company still needs to pay the lease payment, its employees, the utility bills, etc. In fact, these expenses grow over time as there’s the impact of inflation.

Scaling down, by closing locations is also not a free option. Not only does it bring penalties for ending a lease contract earlier, but it also leads to losing all the revenue and profitability from that location.

The company is generating substantial cash flows, but I’ll argue the capital allocation is poor.

||all numbers in €m|
|:-|:-|
|Cash (January 2019)|€1.837|
|Operating cash flow|€21.541|
|Capex|(€7.772)|
|Acquisitions|(€6.559)|
|Debt|€4.887|
|Share buyback|(€2.034)|
|Dividends|(€8.229)|
|Other|€25|
|Cash (June 2024)|€3.696|

Between 2019 and H1-2024, the company generated **over €21.5 billion** in operating cash flow, or **a bit less than €14 billion after capex.**

Close to 60% of it was returned back to the shareholders via dividends, and an additional 15% through share buybacks. What’s left of the free cash flow, together with additional debt, was used for acquisitions.

Why do I think the capital allocation is poor? Two main reasons:

1. Almost 80% of the share buybacks were used in 2021 and 2022, the years when the share price was the highest (and temporarily elevated). A good capital allocator can recognize when the price is too high to buy back shares.
2. Its net debt position more than doubled, from **€7.1 billion** in 2019 to **€15.4 billion** as of June 30th, 2024. This is equal to \~60% of its market cap. The interest rate on their debt ranges from 0.75% to 5% and if the refinancing is done at a higher rate, it could significantly reduce its profit margins.



**4.0 What can be expected?**

Based on the latest investor presentation, there are three capital allocation priorities:

* Organic growth;
* Shareholder return; and
* Fuel high-potential adjacent businesses.

All of it, while having a **healthy financial situation and FCF generation.**

This is a good attempt by the management to summarize what to expect from the company. I find this slide a bit odd for three reasons:

1. On one side they want to return capital to the shareholders, which would position them as a company **with a goal to preserve capital and provide reliable dividends**. On the other side, its history is full of **acquisitions, which is the opposite of preserving capital.**
2. The center of the slide points to a healthy financial situation and FCF generation, while its net debt more than doubled in the last 5 years (**€7.1 billion** in 2019 to **€15.4 billion** as of June 30th, 2024).
3. Innovation is not a focus at all. Roughly 2 months ago, EssilorLuxottica and Meta announced a partnership in the smart eyewear category. I see a lot of potential in this area that isn’t utilized (yet).

**Growing through acquisitions and distributing dividends seems to be the DNA of the company and likely what one should expect going forward.**

  
**5.0 Dividends**

The dividend per share has been steadily increasing from €4 back in 2015, to €14 in 2024. The current dividend yield is \~6%.

If the management focuses on reducing the debt and dividends (instead of borrowing to acquire more companies), Kering could become an incredibly appealing dividend investment option.

  
**6.0 High employee turnover**

At the end of 2023, the company had 48,964 employees. During the year, there were **13,403** new hires, and **11,275** employees departed. At first glance, this is no doubt a high turnover.

This sounds bad at first, but it is really difficult to decipher.

In theory, any company that has seasonal employment patterns will hire more employees (temporarily) during peak seasons. Therefore the increase, and subsequently decrease, of employees is normal. This is even more so in industries where the work is repetitive (such as sales and manufacturing).

In addition, 59% of the employees are Gen Y (1981-1995), a generation that is known for seeking career growth, which could lead to more job-hopping than average.

Given the reviews on Indeed, Glassdoor, and Comparably, there is no indication that this is currently a serious issue.

  
**7.0 The concerns**

**7.1 Balenciaga Advertising Scandal (2022)**

Back in 2022, Balenciaga faced significant backlash over their advertising campaign. One of them featured children holding teddy bears dressed in bondage-inspired outfits. This was rightfully criticized and labeled as inappropriate.

This brings into question the ethics behind those who are in charge of product development and marketing.

In addition, given how concentrated their portfolio is in the top 3 brands (Gucci - 46%, YSL - 17%, Bottega Veneta - 9%), scandals of this kind could have a significant impact.

**7.2 Preliminary investigation by the European Commission (2023)**

In April 2023, the European Commission initiated a preliminary investigation into potential antitrust violations within the fashion sector. One of the inspections took place at the Italian premises of Gucci.

An investigation of this kind does not imply guilt, but if a company is found in breach of EU antitrust rules, there could lead to a fine of a few billion euros.

The investigation is still ongoing, and no conclusions have been reached.

  
**8.0 Valuation** 

This is a mature market that will be around for a very long time. Therefore, here are my assumptions when it comes to valuing Kering:

* **Revenue** \- The industry is cyclical in nature, so there will be good and bad times. Based on the past, I do not feel confident that Kering can take market share, so I expect its growth to normalize at \~3% per year, which is in line with the inflation rate.
* **Operating margin** \- The luxury market is getting more crowded, and as argued earlier, reducing operating expenses is not an easy task. Once the demand is somewhat stable, I expect the operating margin to increase to 21%.

Based on those assumptions (and a discount rate of \~9%), the fair value of the company is **€27 billion (€220/share)** which is very close to the current price of **€224/share**.

This offers an IRR of \~9%, which is slightly below the historical return of the S&P500.

  
**8.1 The Bull Case**

Those who are betting on Kering, are ultimately betting that there will be revenue growth and margin expansion through some of the following:

* Revitalization of Balenciaga & rebuilding its reputation after the controversies;
* Sustained growth in Gucci, and expansion of secondary brands like Bottega Veneta & Saint Laurent;
* The success of its newly launched beauty division, capturing market share from rivals like LVMH and Estee Lauder;
* Positive macro tailwinds;

* Utilizing pricing power;
* Integration of recent acquisitions;
* Reducing operating costs;

**If the management can pull this off, then the value per share could be 2x from today’s share price.**



**8.2 The Bear Case**

Those who are betting against Kering, are ultimately betting that there will be revenue decline and margin compression through some of the following:

* Brand mismanagement & more scandals;
* Inability to revitalize Balenciaga;
* Inability to innovate around its primary brands;
* Failure to integrate its acquisitions & further poor M&A acquisitions;
* Negative macro tailwinds;
* Inability to innovate around E-Commerce;
* Supply chain issues;
* Competitive pressure;
* Increase in corporate tax by the French authorities

**In this scenario, the fair value per share could be below €100/share.**

stocks,Looking for advice: combining technical analysis with news-based and high-volatility trading,"Hi everyone,
I’ve been trading more actively lately, focusing on high-volatility stocks and news-based opportunities. This year has been very successful for me. I’ve managed to achieve returns that were even above the S&P 500, so I’m really happy with my progress.

That said, I’m always looking to improve, and I’m wondering if integrating technical analysis into my approach could help me refine my strategy further. I usually hold my positions for a few days to a few weeks. I have a few questions:
	
1.	Which technical indicators would you recommend for someone trading on a short to medium term basis and reacting to news-driven moves?
	
2.	Are there specific timeframes or chart setups that work better for trades lasting days or weeks? 
	
3.	Are there any books, courses, or resources you’d recommend for learning technical analysis, especially for high-volatility setups?
	
4.	How do you handle risk management when trading in such volatile environments?

5.   How can I identify which stocks are likely to have the highest trading volume or volatility during the day ?

I know there’s no one size fits all solution, but I believe combining fundamental insights with technical analysis could help me make better informed decisions.


Thanks in advance to anyone who shares their experience or advice!

The company seems solid, especially with its strength in enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure, even though consumer PC sales have been an ongoing problem. Despite this Dell has been doubling down on AI, data centers, and hybrid cloud, which I believe should set them up well for growth in 2025. They also stand to benefit from SMCI’s issues and Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure. With the growing focus on AI and enterprise tech, it feels like Dell could see steady, long-term growth and break out to that $150 range by Q2 2024.

stocks,Rivian Receives Conditional Commitment for up to $6.6 Billion Loan from the U.S. Department of Energy,"RVINE, Calif., November 26, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--American all-electric automaker Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) today announced it has received conditional commitment from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) Loan Program for a loan of up to $6.6 billion (including $6 billion of principal and approximately $600 million of capitalized interest) to accelerate its growth and leadership of electric vehicle design, development and manufacturing in the United States.

If finalized, the loan would support the construction of Rivian’s next facility in Stanton Springs North, near the city of Social Circle, Georgia, substantially expanding the company’s domestic production capacity to support demand from the United States and international markets. This loan from DOE would provide significant funding for production of the company’s midsize platform, which underpins the R2, a midsize SUV, and the R3/R3X, a midsize crossover. Designed, engineered, and built in America to deliver an incredible combination of capability, function, performance, and pricing, Rivian believes its R2 and R3 vehicle lines will be critical drivers in the company’s long-term growth and profitability.

The DOE loan would provide an important boost to the U.S. automotive industrial base, enabling significant job creation and investment that is important for the United States to maintain its leadership as electric vehicles become a strategically important industry.

Rivian intends to build the facility in two phases, each resulting in 200,000 units of annual production capacity, for a total of 400,000 units of annual capacity–supporting the sale of American EVs in international markets. Phase 1 of the project is expected to start production in 2028. Rivian is expected to create approximately 7,500 operations jobs through 2030 at the company’s future manufacturing facility in Georgia. This is in addition to 2,000 expected full-time construction jobs that will utilize the region’s significant talent and workforce to further strengthen the domestic EV ecosystem. These jobs complement the thousands Rivian has already created and plans to maintain at its current plant in Normal, Illinois, which have bolstered the local and regional economy.

""This loan will help create thousands of new American jobs and further strengthen U.S. leadership in EV manufacturing and technology,"" said Rivian Founder and CEO RJ Scaringe. ""This loan would enable Rivian to more aggressively scale our U.S. manufacturing footprint for our competitively priced R2 and R3 vehicles that emphasize both capability and affordability. A robust ecosystem of U.S. companies developing and manufacturing EVs is critical for the U.S. to maintain its long-term leadership in transportation.""

Rivian plans to design and build a fully modern manufacturing facility at the Stanton Springs Site, less than one hour’s drive from downtown Atlanta, employing modern construction techniques and advanced environmental management while preserving natural spaces and investing actively in the surrounding communities.

Over the history of the loan program, DOE has helped energize American EV manufacturing with billions in financing for this strategically important industry, including loans to General Motors and Tesla.

While this conditional commitment indicates DOE’s intent to finance the project, DOE and the company must satisfy certain technical, legal, environmental, and financial conditions before the Department of Energy enters into definitive financing documents and funds the loan. If finalized, the loan would be secured by all assets of the project and fixed assets and guarantees of the parent company, Rivian Automotive, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries.

stocks,These are the stocks on my watchlist (11/26),"# I'm back.

Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader.

This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I only hold some/all MAG 7 stocks and market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions. I use IBKR TWS for my platform and charts.

I am targeting potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. This means the potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, not the business, long-term prospects, or the people involved.

PLEASE ask specific questions and PLEASE don’t ask about earnings because I typically don’t take positions before earnings announcements. Questions like “Thoughts on \_\_\_\_\_?” or “Why isn’t \_\_\_ on the watchlist?” or something answered already will be ignored unless you add detail and your opinion.  If you post a question and delete it after I answer it, I will block you- doing that hurts discussion. I am not answering questions if I’m still long or short a stock beyond what I update.

stocks,Opinions on ZETA?,"
I have watched this stock for some time and it is super interesting.

• Culper research shorts ZETA and publishes findings on some misconducts from ZETA.

• Shares drop big time

• ZETA responds to all claims from culper and
""proves"" them as lies. One of examples is that Culper mentiones EY as ZETA's auditor but EY was never ZETA's auditor. It was always Deloitte...

• ZETA insiders buy large amount of shares as another sign to support the company and that Culper research is lying and playing dirty.

• Shares bounce back a bit.

• Former Louisiana attorney general leads class action suit against ZETA (another dirty move to stop a bounce back or honestly concerned ex politician?).

• Shares drop this week again.

Isn't it crazy how few people can destroy a company for personal interest using deception and dirty tricks? Or is the company the one that is corrupt?

In my opinion Culper clearly lied on many things as a strategy for their short positions, history showed that companies that were shorted by Culper did just fine in the future. Is this case the same?

What is your opinion on this? Is it good entry point, is it too risky to enter.

Btw fundamentals of this company are good.
Healthy growth, nice debt ratio and management, strong institutional ownership etc.

stocks,"California plan excludes Tesla from new EV tax credits, governor's office says","Tesla's electric vehicles likely would not qualify for California's new state tax credits under a proposal in the works if President-elect Donald Trump scraps the federal tax credit for EV purchases, Governor Gavin Newsom's office said on Monday.
Tesla shares closed down 4%.

Trump's transition team is considering eliminating the federal tax credit of $7,500 for EV purchases, Reuters reported this month.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close Trump adviser, sharply criticized the idea of barring the automaker from EV subsidies writing on X in response ""Even though Tesla is the only company who manufactures their EVs in California! This is insane.""

Musk has said he supports ending subsidies for EVs, oil and gas.

Newsom said on Monday that if Trump eliminates a federal EV tax credit, he will propose creating a new version of the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program that ended in 2023 and spent $1.49 billion to subsidize more than 594,000 vehicles.

""The governor’s proposal for ZEV rebates, and any potential market cap, is subject to negotiation with the legislature. Any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition, innovation and to support new market entrants,"" the office said.

California provided up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of a new plug-in hybrid, battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the state's cap-and-trade program.

Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Tesla's Fremont factory during the pandemic and California's approval of a bill on transgender kids.

In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas, and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Last month, a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state's plan to halt the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism.
California's rules, which have been adopted by a dozen other states, require 80% of all new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035 and no more than 20% plug-in hybrid electric.

stocks,Speculate on GOOG - what'd be the best countermove against DoJ slaps? ,"For those who were sleeping/partying on the weekend, the following happened:

* DoJ said, Google should divest off Chrome and may not reenter the browser market for five years
* prohibited from ""acquiring any interests in search rivals, potential entrants, and rival search or search ads-related AI products""
* halt all ""anticompetitive payments to distributors, including Apple, Samsung"" so that Google isn't the default search engine on their devices
* content creators can choose to opt-out of Google crawlers to train its AI

Most obvious historical comparison is case against Microsoft Corp. in 2001; the DoJ tried to split Microsoft up due to its hold over the web browser market on Windows, though this case **ultimately resulted in a settlement**. With that in mind, it is possible, the DoJ will go this way, this time.

* Search is close to 50% revenue of Google \[Q3 results\]
* Browsers market shares: Chrome 60%, Safari 18%, Edge 8% \[Source can be contested, because it's larger devices stats only\]
* Android - 70% market share in handheld devices

GOOG has to fight hard to ensure a high search traffic. It may have a few options up its sleeves.

stocks,MDA Space blowing up by year’s end (contract incoming),"All this hype with RKLB, LUNR, and RDW and no-one is mentioning MDA (mktcap - 3.2b CAD). Yeah I know it mainly trades on Toronto but just get a broker that supports Toronto, eg IBKR. They’re planning to list on US soon but by then it will probably already have taken off...

Their earnings report was stellar: growth of 38% yoy, it is actually **PROFITABLE** \- none of the other space companies are profitable - profitability with adjusted EBITDA of $55.5 million, up 30% YoY, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.7%, net income up 60% yoy, and net debt adjusted EBITDA ratio of just 0.8x (so zero risk of dilution). However, post earnings the stock was mostly flat. Why? Their reported backlog was unchanged from previous quarter report (backlog is 4.6B btw).

But if any of you folks had bothered to tune in to the call, you would have heard the CEO say that it is a fact that by year end they will be **definitely be signing a new contract worth 750M** – of these, only 300M is recorded in backlog – a**n additional $450M is going to be added** upon finalization and t**his will happen by year’s end.** They in fact stated during the Q&A that they are confident they will be finishing 2024 with $5B backlog. They also said MDA’s satellite systems division alone has a $**15B+ pipeline** of potential projects, thanks to its Aurora-class satellites tailored for low Earth orbit (LEO) constellations.

Still not convinced? Consider:

\> MDA is building a new 185,000 sq. ft. facility in Quebec, **capable of producing two satellites per day** starting in late 2025.

\>Planet labs is currently generating about 200million in revenue per year. MDA’s geointelligence segment is also generating about 200million in revenue per year. However, MDA’s geo segment represents **only about 20%** of MDA’s total revenue. PL’s marketcap is currently almost **1B**. MDA is 3.1 CAD = **2.2B USD**. Oh, and PL is currently operating at a loss (though that might change next report) but MDA is running a profit. Based on this fact alone, MDA’s mkt cap should be at least double than what it is.

stocks,Ganja Bear Case (and one possible exception),"I think cannabis is an abysmally bad investment opportunity (with one exception) and almost no one knows why, because the precise nature of how THC as a drug operates isn't well understood by people who aren't both habitual consumers \*and\* up-to-date with knowledge on that sector this past decade or so.

It's the following issue: Let's say it's 2010 when cannabis is still illegal everywhere and I want to get high, I light up a single (1) joint with my friend, we smoke for 20 minutes, and then we're giggling. We go to buy some twice a month or so. A few years later it's been legalized and a ton of money floods into the space. Growers are all trying to compete with each other to take advantage of the laws changing, everyone wants to make stronger weed that gets you high more quickly than the other kinds, to draw customers to them, get market share and so on. ""Buy my iridescent purple galactic stardust reefer that gets you as high in one puff as 10x that amount of the neighboring place's stuff.""

This is a race to the bottom. Soon everyone is selling incredibly strong stuff, but you need \*far less\* of it to get the same high. Habitual users spend less than 10% of what they used to on weed now, everything is absurdly strong and cheap because of this competition. In addition you now have hash oil, edibles, dab pens, tinctures, you name it. Not just regular flower.

I never smoked much anyway, but in the rare case I want a mini-vacation now, I can take a vial of Tincture and put \*one drop\* under my tongue. Within two hours the world is spinning. It's so strong I never use it as anything other than a sleeping aid about once a month. A single bottle of this costs about $65, and it comfortably lasts me an entire year. This is a disaster for the industry because I almost never need to give them business. It's so strong that I rarely need to make a purchase at all. And no need for all the paraphernalia with it either. No vapes, pipes, lighters etc. The bottle comes with an eyedropper. Even if I use it often and develop a high tolerance, I still rarely need to go out for more. My friend and I have no reason to go smoke or spend much money on the supplies for it when for 1/100th the price we can get the same high now, assuming one of us has a tincture (or dab vape pen, or edible, or a newly exotic and potent strain) at home.

Compare this with alcohol, where you can't make, say, vodka much stronger than it is. It's impossible for me to come up with a 10x stronger vodka to put my competitors out of business because it's physically impossible for alcohol to exist at room temperature at concentrations higher than \~97% (I think), and vodka is already around 45% and can't reasonably go much higher (taste etc). Also there is a social nature to it that weed lacks, beer works more as a refreshment beverage like coke etc.

Or cigarettes, where even if you have a huge nicotine tolerance from constant Zyn use, the nature of the substance requires you to take it every couple hours to keep from getting jittery. You can't just get a year's supply of nicotine in a bottle because (first of all it'd be fatal with a slight dosage error) you need to have it in measured amounts you can take every 2-4 hours regardless of how much you're used to consuming, assuming you're dependent on it to begin with of course. And so it is a consistent business for sellers. This is most true of cigarettes, but also applies to vapes and pouches, which have similarly excellent profit margins. All of these a nicotine addict must consume regularly. Regulations also limit how much nicotine you can put in each product.

It is a subscription model, in short, while weed is equivalent to motor oil in terms of how often someone (a very heavy user to boot) has to go out and buy some, and how much they spend. Alcohol has some issues as well of lesser magnitude that I can go into elsewhere, but can lean on its usefulness in social situations whereas weed cannot.

The only exception to this? Turning Point Brands (TPB) stock, because they don't sell weed. They sell rolling papers and other paraphernalia for it. Which is indeed still a growing business if it gets legalized in more places and benefits from the greater proliferation of the stuff. Actual weed sellers do not, because the increased proliferation is offset by people needing to buy less of it for the same results due to increased THC concentration in the products. You can't sell 1/10th as much paper to people for the same effect, or at least it's less affected by this issue. The company also is wisely getting into nicotine pouches although this is very ambitious of them to compete with the tobacco majors directly on something. Not sure how that'll work out. Keep in mind this is a small cap company, less than $1 billion in market cap, reflecting how little profit there is to be made even on the periphery of this sector. But it's one small and thriving business I can find that has benefited from all this quite nicely. Not sure how much more it can grow, it's probably overvalued now, but in the past year or so it's risen strongly.

Otherwise? Cronos and other weed stocks? Bunk. For the birds. There might be an exception for medical marijuana (CBD) companies but that's pure conjecture as far as I know.

stocks,Evaluation of Companies with Down Revenue,"I find this an interesting topic and am interested how others feel if a company would be considered potentially bullish with the following fundamentals.

- Cash flow per share growth (year over year)
- *Net profit margin growth (year over year)
- Lower long-term debt (year over year)

BUT ALSO HAS…

- Lower revenue (year over year)
- Lower net income (year over year)
- Lower earnings per share (year over year)

In my opinion when revenue (or net income) is declining, and not flat or increasing, it is a concern that the company could be on the brink of a big downturn. Especially in a continued pattern of these results.

However, I often see companies with these symptoms, (sometimes in different combinations but at least two of these are lower year over year), however the chart is very bullish at times…

Thoughts? (Thanks in advance for your opinion)

stocks,Delaware Funds by Macquarie,"Does anyone have any insight into Delaware Funds managed by Macquarie? 

Unfortunately, I was persuaded to purchase into one of the small / mid cap mutual funds in December 2020. Obviously the market was on a bit of a run there, but everything about the fund (historical build up, Morningstar ratings, length of existence of the fund, recommendations by publications, YoY performance,  etc) led me to believe it was a reasonable, if somewhat more aggressive, investment.  

It was all well and good for about a year, as the market rebounded from Covid and this particular fund hummed along with the rest of the economy.   Articles like [this in the mainstream press](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/4-stock-picks-for-the-post-pandemic-nesting-economy-from-a-five-star-money-manager-11636995166?mod=bnbh_mwarticle) lent further credence that the fund was solid and the fund managers respected by financial journalism. 

And then it did a capital gains distribution (historically very normal for this fund) in December 2021 and then the share price immediately started its plummet.  Like, overnight, lost $15/share.  Similarly, it went seemingly overnight from a Morningstar 5 rating to a 2 rating.  It continued to fall from there. 

  
I guess I am one of those silly buy and hold people.  I always assume that short term losses will eventually be made up in the long term.  Since then....no. 

  
Earlier this year, Delaware merged a couple of their funds, so DFDIX became IYMIX.   As far as I can tell, the holdings in IYMIX are not radically different than what DFDIX held.   In a market that has been turbo charged for the past year, the growths of this fund have been glacial.   I realize that the holdings are small / mid cap and those are ostensibly still being knocked around by high interest rates, but the three years since that initial freefall following the capital gains distribution has not really begun to make up the ground that the fund dramatically lost. 

I've literally never been in a mutual fund that actively lost money for me.  Plenty have not grown in dramatic ways, but actually halving of value?  That's never happened before. 

Does anyone have any insight into this investment company or explanation why a small / midcap fund would depreciate to such a dramatic extent and fail to recover over a period of years when stock market growth is explosive?

stocks,What I learnt from MSTR frenzy,"I have been a long term investor in MSTR, in fact buying  my position Pre-split.  
My thesis was very much connected to an alternative investment vehicle into Bitcoin.  Even though I have BTC as a holding in my crypto, I was more after exposure in an equity portfolio.

To cut a long story short, I bought it when it was no mainstream and no ETF's were existing.

I must admit, I sat on a loss for about one year in MSTR.  Buying at $48.10 (split adjusted), and for the longest time sitting at the $25-$30 range, BTC was consolidating and I was fine with that.

If people understand what MSTR are doing, this playbook with bonds and hedging BTC was already in play for a long time, I was lucky enough to understand this quite early and and bought it quite early.  The difference being now that BTC is on a breakout and other companies are now looking into this method as well, the eyes on MSTR has multiplied exponentially .

Fast forward one year, and and the FOMO crowd arrived, and with that volatility.

Here is what I learnt when the FOMO arrived:

1. The stock is no longer trading on anything but emotion and speculation.
2. Valuations do not matter anymore.  The premium on BTC was as low as 1.5 less than one year go, reaching a peak earlier this week at 3.5
3. The stock goes up like crazy, and comes down like crazy, and when this happens, it's time to exit as there is nothing that is in your control.
4. There is so much manipulation (e.g. the citron report, Social media, Mainstream coverage), on what... a damn tweet!  it is not really easy to understand how this will move, so at this point it is just gambling.

I held my position up to the $543 level, and eventually my stop losses triggered yesterday around the $500 level.  So after 1.5 years, I am out of the MSTR trade.

The lesson I learnt is when the crowds arrive, turn round and walk away.

I still believe in the MSTR playbook, but will only come back when I am at the front of the queue buying at a negotiated price not when I am in a bidding war with gamblers.",513,174,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gx4xb6/what_i_learnt_from_mstr_frenzy/,long term investor mstr fact buying position presplit thesis much connected alternative investment vehicle bitcoin even though btc holding crypto exposure equity portfolio cut long story short bought mainstream etf existing must admit sat loss one year mstr buying split adjusted longest time sitting range btc consolidating fine people understand mstr playbook bond hedging btc already play long time lucky enough understand quite early bought quite early difference btc breakout company looking method well eye mstr multiplied exponentially fast forward one year fomo crowd arrived volatility learnt fomo arrived stock longer trading anything emotion speculation valuation matter anymore premium btc low le one year go reaching peak earlier week stock go like crazy come like crazy happens time exit nothing control much manipulation eg citron report social medium mainstream coverage damn tweet really easy understand move point gambling held position level eventually stop loss triggered yesterday around level year mstr trade lesson learnt crowd arrive turn round walk away still believe mstr playbook come back front queue buying negotiated price bidding war gambler,0.023333333333333338,Positive
stocks,Thoughts and dilemma on Rocket Lab? ,"I went into Rocket Lab back in July with the intention of making it my primary long-term growth stock and since then have managed to acquire 440 shares at average price of around $9.  

My intention was/is to keep buying and hold the stock for many many years, because I truly believe in the company potential and the overall space industry and I believe that it will be a key growth sector for the next decade and beyond regardless of who is in power in the US. (I am not american btw)

Just before the election I was in profit in the low thousands, which was nice but since the election I am now sitting at a profit of 147%, which is my best position in my investing ""career"" so far. 

Like I said, I believe the company will do well regardless of who is in power. However, given the fast rise since the election I am expecting correction happening soon. 

And my dilemma is: should exit now and take the profits and then go back in after the correction? Or should I just hold until the potential correction and start buying more then?

stocks,Are we putting too much faith in generative AI? Could this hurt AI investments more broadly?,"Obviously a lot of money is being made off of AI-related stocks. I'm not one of those lucky investors. Part of the reason is that I fear we're not in a general AI bubble, as many have discussed, but rather a *generative AI* bubble. I'd appreciate hearing how others feel about this.

Right now, by far the bulk of investment is focused on generative AI (especially LLMs), with NVDA at or very near the center of it all, thanks to its GPUs. Meanwhile, alternative AI approaches (e.g., neuromorphic computing, symbolic AI, reinforcement learning, and hybrid models) have been getting far less attention.

The problem? As impressive as it may seem, generative AI has some significant (and inherent) drawbacks:

* Factually unreliable outputs (it can’t reliably distinguish fact from fiction)
* Probabilistic reasoning (no true causal understanding)
* High computational costs (questionable sustainability)
* Limited real-world problem-solving abilities

At some point, the reality of generative AI's limitations will become apparent enough to investors that we could see an AI market correction or even collapse. This would not only hurt AI stocks like NVDA, but it could also starve funding for alternative AI approaches that have long-term potential yet have been largely overlooked.

What do you think? How is this influencing your investment decisions?",54,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gxezqq/are_we_putting_too_much_faith_in_generative_ai/,obviously lot money made airelated stock im one lucky investor part reason fear general ai bubble many discussed rather generative ai bubble id appreciate hearing others feel right far bulk investment focused generative ai especially llm nvda near center thanks gpus meanwhile alternative ai approach eg neuromorphic computing symbolic ai reinforcement learning hybrid model getting far le attention problem impressive may seem generative ai significant inherent drawback factually unreliable output cant reliably distinguish fact fiction probabilistic reasoning true causal understanding high computational cost questionable sustainability limited realworld problemsolving ability point reality generative ai limitation become apparent enough investor could see ai market correction even collapse would hurt ai stock like nvda could also starve funding alternative ai approach longterm potential yet largely overlooked think influencing investment decision,0.14985260770975056,Positive
stocks,C3AI begins to turn the tide,"C3.ai shares jumped 25% in a single day on the announcement of a deeper partnership with Microsoft. The new agreement clarifies Microsoft Azure as C3.ai's preferred cloud services platform and C3.ai's AI applications as Azure's preferred enterprise solutions. Although the two have been working together since 2018, this announcement pushes the market's focus on its AI potential higher.

Underestimated potential: c3.ai's revenue grew 21% in the quarter and is expected to grow 24% going forward. Current market capitalization is \~$4 billion and trades at a multiple of 11x its FY2025 revenue target.

Pilots: The company has 224 pilots, 85% of which are active, representing a 117% year-over-year increase in the number of pilots. 70% of pilots are expected to be converted into formal contracts.

Future Potential: Revenues are expected to pick up to 30% from current growth rates through pilots to formal deals. 2026 FY projected revenue target is $462 million, with a share price potential of up to $36 if it reaches an 8x EV/revenue valuation.

While the partnership has boosted market enthusiasm, I would wait for market sentiment to pull back before getting in. In addition, the conversion of pilots to full-fledged programs is key to future growth.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

stocks,Intuit shares drop as quarterly forecast misses estimates due to delayed revenue,"Intuit shares fell 6% in extended trading Thursday after the finance software maker issued a revenue forecast for the current quarter that trailed analysts’ estimates due to some sales being delayed.

Here’s how the company performed in comparison with LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $2.50 adjusted vs. $2.35 expected

Revenue: $3.28 billion vs. $3.14 billion

Revenue increased 10% year over year in the quarter, which ended Oct. 31, according to a statement. Net income fell to $197 million, or 70 cents per share, from $241 million, or 85 cents per share, a year ago.

While results for the fiscal first quarter topped estimates, second-quarter guidance was light. Intuit said it anticipates a single-digit decline in revenue from the consumer segment because of promotional changes for the TurboTax desktop software in retail environments. While that will affect revenue timing, it won’t have any impact on the full 2025 fiscal year.

Intuit called for second-quarter earnings of $2.55 to $2.61 per share, with $3.81 billion to $3.85 billion in revenue. The consensus from LSEG was $3.20 per share and $3.87 billion in revenue.

For the full year, Intuit expects $19.16 to $19.36 in adjusted earnings per share on $18.16 billion to $18.35 billion in revenue. That implies revenue growth of between 12% and 13%. Analysts polled by LSEG were looking for $19.33 in adjusted earnings per share and $18.26 billion in revenue.

Revenue from Intuit’s global business solutions group came in at $2.5 billion in the first quarter. The figure was up 9% and in line with estimates, according to StreetAccount. Formerly known as the small business and self-employed segment, the group includes Mailchimp, QuickBooks, small business financing and merchant payment processing.

“We are seeing good progress serving mid-market customers in MailChimp, but are seeing higher churn from smaller customers,” Sandeep Aujla, Intuit’s finance chief, said on a conference call with analysts. “We are addressing this by making product enhancements and driving feature discoverability and adoption to improve first-time use and customer retention.”

Better outcomes are a few quarters away, Aujla said.

CreditKarma revenue came in at $524 million, above StreetAccount’s $430 million consensus.

At Thursday’s close, Intuit shares were up about 9% so far in 2024, while the S&P 500 has gained almost 25% in the same period.

On Tuesday Intuit shares slipped 5% after The Washington Post said President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed “Department of Government Efficiency” had discussed developing a mobile app for federal income tax filing. But a mobile app for submitting returns from Intuit is “already available to all Americans,” CEO Sasan Goodarzi told CNBC’s Jon Fortt.

Goodarzi said on CNBC that he’s personally communicating with leaders of the incoming presidential administration.

On the earnings call, Goodarzi sounded optimistic about the economy.

“Our belief, which is not baked into our guidance, is that we will see an improved environment as we look ahead in 2025, particularly just with some of the things that I mentioned earlier around just interest rates, jobs, the regulatory environment,” he said. “These things have a real burden on businesses. And we believe that a better future is to come.”

stocks,Zeta global short attack,"Hi, I've been following ZETA global for quite while now. It has recently suffered a 50% blow to its SP due to not good enough earnings followed by a report from short seller ""Culper research"".
 I won't go into details of thier report, but after reading it I believe it is of very low quality (they even got the ZETAs auditor wrong lol).

After the decline of the price I was tempted to start building a position, especially since the SP was starting to recover. However, today in PM the shares are going back to around 20$. Another short seller (Lauren Balik) has published a report. To me it once again seems like a blatant attempt of trying to lower the price. It is overblown and full of speculation. She also published similiar articles on NVDA, APP, SNOW. But the market is dumping anyway.

My question is - how likely is it going to actually hurt the company long term? Is it too risky to enter now? Do you know of some other companies targeted by mulriple short sellers In the past (I would like to examine how they did or did not recover)?

stocks,Deep dive into Etsy - On a path to a dangerous spiral,"**1.0 Introduction**

Etsy started by brilliantly carving out a niche in handmade and vintage goods, but now it faces challenges that threaten its unique spot in e-commerce and I’ll argue it is going down the path to a dangerous spiral.

The idea to connect buyers with sellers of handmade/vintage goods is amazing, and there’s no doubt that there is demand for it.

Any marketplace has two important metrics:

* The **Gross Merchandise Value**, also known as “GMV”, represents the value of all products sold through the website. Etsy decided to use **Gross Merchandise Sales** (“GMS“), which is just a different term.
* The **take-rate** represents their share of the GMS.

Its GMS increased from \~$4 billion in 2018 (prior to the pandemic) to $13.5 billion in 2021. However, since then, Etsy has experienced a decline and the GMS in 2023 was $13.2 billion. The lack of growth is either a lack of demand or a lack of supply in the marketplace.

**2.0 The real problem**

The company discloses the number of active buyers and sellers, and together, they paint quite a picture.

The number of active sellers continued to grow. From 2021 to 2023, it increased from 7.5 million to 9 million.

The number of buyers has been flat.

Economics101 teaches us a simple lesson: ***If the demand is stable, and there is an increase in supply, the prices will decrease.***

Economics also teaches that ***lower prices would attract more buyers, increasing the demand.***

***So, where are the buyers?***

As Etsy doesn’t (and cannot) check the quality of all the products, more and more AI-generated product images combined with dropshipping flood the market. Here's a comment from a Reddit user that in my opinion does a great job summarizing the development:

""*Drop-shipping has absolutely ruined online marketplaces. I used to adore Etsy when it first started, but now its just absolute garbage. You have to reverse image search everything nowadays to make sure it's the real deal and actually handmade. This recently happened to me when I was trying to buy some pretty dice for my dnd group. Turned out it was a scam using a real artisan's pictures to sell their cheap shit. Thankfully, I was able to rectify the issue, but it was a hustle.*""

The U.S. sellers used to contribute over 75% of Etsy’s revenue a decade ago. Now, it’s down to \~50%.

I’ll argue that this might lead to a spiral that will harm Etsy in the long run, with the events being:

1. Increase in low-value products on Etsy.
2. The low-value products will be perceived as a better deal when compared to the high-value products as they are cheaper.
3. The sellers of high-value products will sell fewer products, and some of them will eventually leave Etsy.
4. The buyers will be disappointed by the low-value products and will not use Etsy as much (or at all).

**3.0 What is Etsy doing?**

Etsy is spending \~30% of its revenue on Marketing (vs. 20% a decade ago) and has even engaged in TV ads to raise awareness and bring new customers.

Over the last few years, the company has been spending $700-800m per year, only to keep the revenue flat. It is accepting the fact that buyers will be disappointed, and the strategy is to replace them with new ones.

**4.0 The take-rate**

The only other way for Etsy to grow its revenue is to increase its take-rate, and its share of the GMS.

The company splits its revenue into two groups:

* **Marketplace revenue** (\~73% of total) - These are **required** fees that cannot be avoided (Transaction fees, payment processing fees, listing fees).
* **Service revenue** (\~27% of total) - These are **optional**, such as on-site advertising, shipping labels, etc.

Its take-rate is incredibly high at \~21%, double from a decade ago. For comparison, eBay’s take rate is \~14%.

**5.0 Terrible management decisions**

As the company was reaching its peak, the management decided to make 3 large acquisitions:

* **Reverb** (Aug 15th, 2019) - A marketplace for new, used, and vintage music gear was acquired for **$270 million**.
* **Elo 7** (July 2nd, 2021) - Also known as the “Etsy of Brazil”, a Brazil-based marketplace for unique, handmade items was acquired for **$212 million**.
* **Depop** (July 12th, 2021) - a global fashion resale marketplace was acquired for \~**$1.5 billion**.

It is important to note that Depop had an annual revenue of **$70 million!** No, this is not a typo. Etsy paid over 20x its revenue to acquire Depop!

Well, not that long later, in Q3-2022, the company recorded impairment charges of **over $1 billion** for Depop and Elo7. No better way to destroy shareholders’ value quickly, than by overpaying for an acquisition.

A year later, in Q3-2023, Elo7 was sold at a loss.

**6.0 Historical financial performance**

Historically, this is still an impressive growth. Its revenue grew from <$200 million a decade ago, to $2.8 billion in the last twelve months and its gross margin remains stable at \~70%.

Its operating margin is lingering around 12% now, as both marketing & product development as % of revenue have been increasing. The increase in marketing expense (as % of revenue) has already been highlighted in a previous section. It is necessary to maintain the buyers’ base. So potential future improvements in the operating margin can only arise by decreasing the product development and general & administrative (as % of revenue).

**7.0 Valuation**

The two key variables when it comes to valuing a company are:

* **Revenue** \- Given that the number of active buyers hasn’t grown in the last few years, it is difficult to expect revenue growth above inflation.
* **Operating margin** \- I do think there’s room to improve the margins by reducing product development and general & administrative (as % of revenue). My assumption is that that it will increase to 14% over time.

Based on my input, the fair value of the company is **$3.2 billion ($29/share)**. This is significantly lower than the current market cap of **$5.7 billion ($51/share)**.

Anyone betting on Etsy is ultimately betting that:

1. The number of low-value products will decrease over time.
2. The number of buyers will start growing again
3. Etsy can continue increasing its take-rate, without losing sellers of high-value products.
4. The management will not engage in acquisition (as they are clearly bad at it).

stocks,"Gap shares surge as it raises guidance, touts ‘strong start’ to holiday","Hurricanes and unseasonably warm weather hit sales at Gap during its fiscal third quarter, but the apparel company still posted better-than-expected results, leading it to raise its annual guidance for a third time this year. 

Gap, which runs Old Navy, Banana Republic, Athleta and its namesake banner, is now expecting fiscal 2024 sales to be up between 1.5% and 2%, compared with previous guidance of “up slightly.” That’s ahead of the 0.4% growth that LSEG analysts had expected, and bodes well for the all-important holiday shopping season, which is now underway. 

The company is also anticipating gross margins and operating income will grow more than it previously expected.

Shares surged about 13% in extended trading.

Here’s how the nation’s largest specialty apparel retailer performed compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 72 cents vs. 58 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $3.83 billion vs. $3.81 billion expected

Gap’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Nov. 2 was $274 million, or 72 cents per share, compared with $218 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier. 

Sales rose to $3.83 billion, up about 2% from $3.78 billion a year earlier.

Across Gap’s business, unseasonably warm weather affected sales by about 1 percentage point during the quarter, while storms and hurricanes led overall store sales to fall by 2%, CEO Richard Dickson told CNBC in an interview. 

“We had unusual circumstances, hurricanes, storms that led to almost 180 closures at the peak of the impact,” said Dickson, adding the storms affected Old Navy, Gap’s largest brand by revenue, the most. 

As soon as the weather turned around, sales “rebounded” and the holiday shopping season is off to a “strong start” so far, said Dickson. 

“We are energized about the holiday. Our teams are really focused on executing our plans. If we compare ourselves to where we were last year, our brands are in a much more pronounced place than they were last year,” he said. “We’ve got stronger brand identities and we’re more practiced in our playbook that we talk a lot about, driving better product, better pricing, more relevance, better consumer experience and excellence in execution.” 

Since Dickson took the helm of Gap a little over a year ago, he’s worked to turn around the business after years of declines. Under his direction, the company has leaned into nostalgic marketing and celebrity partnerships to reclaim cultural relevance. Sales have grown for the last four quarters in a row, but the company is still smaller than it once was, and critics say it needs to do more to fix its product assortment and drive full-price selling.

Here’s a closer look at each brand’s performance: 

**Old Navy:** Gap said sales at its largest brand grew 1% to $2.2 billion, while comparable sales were flat, shy of the 0.9% growth that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Old Navy’s kids category was particularly affected by the warmer weather, said Dickson. 

**Gap:** Gap’s eponymous banner grew 1% to $899 million during the quarter, while comparable sales were up 3% — better than the 2.3% growth Wall Street expected, according to StreetAccount. The brand has seen four straight quarters of positive comparable sales and is benefiting from better marketing and product, the company said. 

**Banana Republic:** The trendy workwear line grew sales 2% to $469 million while comparable sales fell 1%, a bit worse than the 0.8% drop that StreetAccount had expected. The brand has worked to turn around its men’s business, which drove results during the quarter. Overall, it is still focused “on fixing the fundamentals,” the company said. 

**Athleta:** The athleisure arm of Gap’s empire grew sales by 4% to $290 million while comparable sales were up 5%. The results weren’t comparable to estimates. In the year-ago period, comparable sales were down 19% at Athleta. Under its new CEO, former Alo Yoga boss Chris Blakeslee, the brand has managed to turn things around.

stocks,Manchester United stock (NYSE: MANU) – potential to grow,"According to Forbes magazine Manchester United is the second most valuable club in football, only behind Real Madrid. Only Real Madrid and Barcelona have more fans in the world. This is despite the fact that last major trophy they won is Premier League in 2013.  This was the last season with Sir Alex Ferguson at the helm – he is the best manager in history of this club. He retired and since then they are struggling a lot and underperforming. Last season they finished 8^(th) in the Premier League, this season they are 13^(th). Disappointment. They play in Europa League, second tier competition in Europe. The real money is in Champions League.

They have a tremendous potential. Big history, a lot of fans, a lot of money. They should compete for the most important throphies every year. But they didn’t in previous years and fans are angry about that.

Things are subject to change though. At the end of 2023 Sir James Ratcliffe bought 25% of club’s shares. He is the fan of the club and he has a lot to say about how the club is run. He is committed to rebuilding club and bring back glory the club aspire to. On January 2024 Omar Berrada was appointed as new CEO of the club, chief executive officer. He joined United after 13 years spent in Manchester City that was the most successful club in England during this period. On July 2024 Dan Ashworth started to work as sporting director. He worked for Newcastle and Brighton previously. He did a really god job there. In Brighton under his watch they transferred in Caicedo, Mac Allister, Cucurella, Mitoma and Trossard, they sold them later for more money. In Newcastle he was in charged when they bought Isak, Gordon, Barnes, Tonali and Botman. Great business. Recently they hired Ruben Amorim, who was successful in Sporting Lisboa. In the summer he was considered as new Liverpool FC manager, eventually they decided to go with Arne Slot who is excellent in his new role.

The future for Manchester United is bright. They have a competent people running the club. Ruben Amorim is one of the best of young managers in the world and seems to be a really good pick who is able to transform the whole club like Jurgen Klopp did it at Liverpool in the last decade. He needs time but he seems to be capable of making Manchester United great again. They were underperforming in the last 10 years but finally they addressed the issues and should be performing better. They need a time, of course, to build strong team. The thing is – if they perform on the pitch, they earn more money. I believe it is the matter of time before they are on the top. And when they reach this level, when they compete amongst really the best, their stock price should be much higher than it is now.

I think they will be a strong again very soon, they will compete and good performance on the pitch will result with big amount of cash going to the club. The next 10 years should be much better than the last 10 years. Currently their stock price is 17,47 USD. They certainly has potential for more. One more reason is – there are more and more money in football every year so this is another factor in favor of this stock.

I think that this club will compete for Premier League and Champions League in 2-4 years and it should have a huge impact on their finances. My opinion is this stock has potential to grow.

*For the quarter ended October 31, Palo Alto Networks reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.56 versus the consensus estimate of $1.47. Revenue totaled $2.14B versus the estimate of $2.12B.*

*For the quarter in progress, Palo Alto Networks expects adjusted earnings per share to range from $1.54 to $1.56, with a mid-point that matches the estimate. Its revenue projection for the second quarter ranges from $2.22B to $2.25B, which represents 13% growth year over year. The mid-point of $2.235B comes in just above the estimate of $2.23B.*   

*Second quarter Next-Generation Security ARR is expected to range from $4.7B to $4.75B, which would represent a year-over-year increase of 20%.*

*Total revenue for fiscal year 2025, which runs from August 2024 through July 2025, is expected to range from $9.12B to $9.17B. This would represent 14% growth year over year.* 

*""Our platformization progress continued in Q1, driving strong financial results,"" said Dipak Golechha, chief financial officer of Palo Alto Networks. ""As a result, we are raising our NGS ARR, revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance for the year.""*

*The board of directors also approved a two-for-one stock split, which will increase the number of authorized common shares from 1B to 2B. Trading on a split-adjusted basis is expected to begin on Dec. 16, 2024.*

I've been a big fan of PANW for the last 2 years. While the billings decline isn't great, it's been expected as the company pushes for platformization. I anticipate this to be great in the long term outlook, but short term, may seem like growth is slowing. Platformization will make their services sticky and harder for companies to leave because they'll be integrated across the business across multiple levels.

Although I'm a big fan of the stock, I will admit it's an expensive one. A lot hinges on future growth of the whole industry and if there are any signs of slowed growth, I think this one will hurt for investors buying at these levels. I'm not in cybersecurity so I'm not sure the likelihood of that, but I'd keep an eye on it. I've made several posts about PANW over the last year and my consensus is I will continue to buy monthly and if there's a large pull back down to <350 I'll look to make a large purchase with cash reserves.",61,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gwgtsd/palo_alto_networks_beats_q1_estimates_shares_fall/,quarter ended october palo alto network reported adjusted earnings per share versus consensus estimate revenue totaled b versus estimate b quarter progress palo alto network expects adjusted earnings per share range midpoint match estimate revenue projection second quarter range b b represents growth year year midpoint b come estimate b second quarter nextgeneration security arr expected range b b would represent yearoveryear increase total revenue fiscal year run august july expected range b b would represent growth year year platformization progress continued q driving strong financial result said dipak golechha chief financial officer palo alto network result raising ng arr revenue nongaap eps guidance year board director also approved twoforone stock split increase number authorized common share b b trading splitadjusted basis expected begin dec ive big fan panw last year billing decline isnt great expected company push platformization anticipate great long term outlook short term may seem like growth slowing platformization make service sticky harder company leave theyll integrated across business across multiple level although im big fan stock admit expensive one lot hinge future growth whole industry sign slowed growth think one hurt investor buying level im cybersecurity im sure likelihood id keep eye ive made several post panw last year consensus continue buy monthly there large pull back ill look make large purchase cash reserve,0.04373015873015872,Positive
stocks,Adani Group shares nosedive after chairman Gautam Adani charged with fraud in New York,"India’s Adani Group saw shares of its companies plunge Thursday after its billionaire chairman Gautam Adani was indicted in a New York federal court over his alleged involvement in an extensive bribery and fraud operation.

The 62-year-old billionaire and the seven other defendants have been accused of paying over $250 million in bribes to Indian government officials to secure solar energy contracts that could generate more than $2 billion in profits.

The Indian group’s flagship firm Adani Enterprises fell 10%, while the company in the eye of the storm Adani Green Energy tanked 17.28%. Adani Energy fell 20%. 

Adani Power lost 13.81%, Adani Port’s share price dropped 10%, while the group’s retail arm Adani Wilmar shed 7.87%.

The benchmark NSE Nifty 50 Index slid 0.63% in its first hour of trade.

Adani, along with two executives from Adani Green Energy Limited — his nephew Sagar Adani and Vneet Jaain — have been charged with misleading U.S. and international investors about the company’s adherence to antibribery and anticorruption standards while raising over $3 billion to finance energy projects.

The five-count indictment in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn also accused Ranjit Gupta and Rupesh Agarwal, former executives of the renewable energy firm Azure Power Global, along with three former employees of the Canadian institutional investor Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec — Saurabh Agarwal, Cyril Cabanes, and Deepak Malhotra.

CDPQ said it is aware of the charges filed. “Those employees were all terminated in 2023 and CDPQ is cooperating with U.S. authorities,” the investor said in an email.

This comes after the conglomerate spent the bulk of last year attempting to move beyond the allegations of accounting fraud and “brazen stock manipulation” made by shortseller firm Hindenburg Research. 

“Since releasing our January 2023 report identifying Adani as the largest corporate con in history, we have never wavered in our view, nor has Adani ever refuted our findings,” Hindenburg said in a statement to CNBC on Thursday.

The conglomerate had rebutted the claims, adding that it has “always been in compliance with all laws.”

These charges do not change the “strong underlying fundamentals” of India’s market or the country’s growth trajectory, said Raymond James’ head of advisory solutions and market strategy, Matt Orton. 

“Once the dust settles, there will be even better opportunities for long-term investors in India,” he said.

Then as we would usually see analysts revise their predictions after the market moves (especially if they called it wrong), to make it seem they are smart or something, BOFA securities revised their predictions, to be even more wrong, showing that they are doubling down on their/people-who-listen-to-theirtrading-advice shorts and are willing to be in denial on a stock even if the market decides they are wrong.

Its not the end of the world to have entrenched shorts, since at the end of the day their losses are unlimited, and when they do close its more capital injected, the longer they waited.

stocks,Any investors here looking at European markets ?,"Let me preface this by saying I live in Europe and after dabbling initially in companies closer to home switched to US markets due to higher historical returns.

This in hindsight was an excellent decision as almost all my investments in the S&P/Nasdaq have outperformed the ones listed in Europe. So do any American guys look at European markets and see any opportunity to create alpha or are bullish on the EU markets. 

There’s an argument to be made that potentially investing into EU serves as a way to diversify and lower exposure to US markets. But I find it very hard to find good European companies with solid fundamentals that have good stock performance. Could be a myriad of reasons including liquidity, slower growth, more regulation and government oversight. 

Personally the three companies I still have in my portfolio in the EU markets is RR, NVO and LVMH. LVMH is slowing down but most likely due to luxury market turmoil and exposure to China. Additionally NVO is listed on NYSE and had uptil recently performed rather well.

So finally my question being are any guys actively eschewing the American markets for European ones or actively increasing their allocation, if so would love to know the rationale. And more importantly any particular industries or geographies that you’re targeting? ",39,148,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gwgyqv/any_investors_here_looking_at_european_markets/,let preface saying live europe dabbling initially company closer home switched u market due higher historical return hindsight excellent decision almost investment spnasdaq outperformed one listed europe american guy look european market see opportunity create alpha bullish eu market there argument made potentially investing eu serf way diversify lower exposure u market find hard find good european company solid fundamental good stock performance could myriad reason including liquidity slower growth regulation government oversight personally three company still portfolio eu market rr nvo lvmh lvmh slowing likely due luxury market turmoil exposure china additionally nvo listed nyse uptil recently performed rather well finally question guy actively eschewing american market european one actively increasing allocation would love know rationale importantly particular industry geography youre targeting,0.10578787878787876,Positive
stocks,Thoughts on building a 10Y high risk portfolio,"Over the past few years I’ve built a portfolio consisting of S&P, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, JPM and BRK. It has done rather well, consistently giving returns of 25%+ annually (except 2022). 

However in recent times my conviction on adding more capital to this portfolio has waned. I just feel the best days in terms of returns for some of the big tech groups may not be what they were for the past decade.

I could 100% be wrong and there is no doubt there is certain bias seeing the return of my smaller positions this year dwarfing the ones of the traditional blue chip guys if you will.

So saying all this I’m considering: 

50% S&P

10% Hood

10% Rddt

10% Rolls Royce

10% Cava

5% Lunr

5% ASTS

Quick rationale for each:

Hood: Expanding to Europe and offering very exciting new products like Hood Gold 

Rddt: Fastest growing social media, ARPU and monetisation only getting better and seeing many more people using

Rolls Royce: Slight European exposure, building low cost Nuclear plants and capturing the wide body aircraft market

Cava: Fantastic management, strong customer retention and expected to double stores in next 5 years

Lunr & ASTS: Moonshot (literally), this is just in case space works out and much more speculative

stocks,Class action lawsuits have been raised against ASML - is it frivolous?,"Firstly, apologies for my English, it's not my first language.

My stock broker have sent me several notifications regarding class action lawsuits being levied against ASML after the last earnings report. The following are the ones I am aware of:

**11/20 - Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman LLC.**  
The complaint alleges ASML misrepresentet or failed to disclose that: (1) the issues being faced by suppliers, like ASML, in the semiconductor industry were much more severe than ASML had indicated to investors, (2) the pace of recovery of sales in the semiconductor industry was much slower than Defendants had publicy acknowledged; (3) ASML had created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to anticipated growth, while downplaying risk from macroeconomic and industry fluctiatinos, as well as stronger regulations restricting the export of semiconductor technology.

**11/20 - Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP.**

The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operation and prospects

**11/19 - Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP.**

**11/19 - The Law Offices of Frank R. Cruz**

**11/19 - Law Offices of Howard G. Smith**

**11/19 - Rosen Law Firm**

**11/19 - Pomerantz Law Firm**

**11/19 - Schall Law Firm**

**11/19 - Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossman**

Have also done the same with similar allegations raised against ASML. Now, it seemed to me after the earnings report that while it was not exactly a good one, I've never really assumed there was any misleading being done. Sometimes you raise guidance, sometimes you lower guidance. 

  
I assume my broker have an obligation to notify me of all of these class action lawsuits, but I've not really seen any discussion about them on any on the forums or news sites I follow, which makes me suspect this perhaps is not such a big deal? I am however not very knowledgeable on American law regarding these kinds of lawsuits.

stocks,The Bullish case for OPRA,"With Google under pressure from the DOJ, this looks like a huge potential for Opera. If Google was forced to sell Chrome, this would give smaller browsers, like Opera, a great chance to gain some market share. Also, when you look at browsers, excluding Edge and Firefox, Opera has a pretty substantial user base by comparison. They are also one of the only ""browser stocks"" that there are. At least the only one of any substance. 



On the flip side, even if Google ISN'T forced to sell Chrome, then we should see the momentum continue for GOOG.

I’ve been a long term holder of OPRA for this very reason. They have a steady growing base of 350M users and are continuing to buy up smaller browser companies. I’ve always looked at OPRA as a hedge against GOOG, at least as far as their browser is concerned. It also pays to hold because they have a great divided.

I’ve been a long term holder of GOOG too though. I think both are great companies, but I’m buying both to more or less hedge my bets.

I think OPRA has a strong chance of seeing some gains if DOJ does follow through.

stocks,How is Viking Therapeutics Inc not a no brainer buy right now?,"After some research, I really beleive this stock is gold:

Viking Therapeutics shared updates on its obesity treatment program for VK2735 at ObesityWeek:

Subjects achieved mean weight loss of up to 8.2% from baseline and 6.8% placebo-adjusted weight loss after 28 days of daily dosing at 100 mg. As far as I am concerned, I believe this is more effective than Mounjaro which demonstrated an average weight loss of approximately 4% of starting body weight after 4 weeks of treatment. 

Also, Oral VK2735 demonstrated a favorable safety profile, with 99% of adverse events classified as mild or moderate. The oral option could revolutionize weight loss treatments by offering greater convenience. 

Let’s look at subcutaneous VK2735 Result(or like doses): Weekly subcutaneous injections led to weight reductions of up to 14.7% from baseline. Up to 88% of treated patients achieved ≥10% weight loss, compared to 4% for placebo. Weight loss was progressive throughout the study, with no plateau at 13 weeks.

The obesity drug market is projected to grow to $130 billion by 2030, offering significant upside for VK2735. This is also important because at this size of a market, it can hold many or multiple big players. Analysts also predict Viking could become a takeover target due to its strong pipeline. This would boost the price up to 3 digits.

What’s more! The company also received praise for its liver disease treatment VK2809, which showed positive results in a Phase 2b trial for MASH (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis), a serious liver condition affecting 22 million Americans. Reductions in liver fat ranging from 37% to 55% at 52 weeks, with response rates (≥30% reduction) as high as 88%, far exceed typical benchmarks. 

The clinical data reinforce VK2735's potential as a best-in-class obesity treatment with effective weight loss, strong safety, and durability of results. The only reason why the stock hasn’t sky-rocketed is because of fear mongering by market makers in the aftermath of RFK junior, and as far as I’m concerned, diabete and liver diseases will not go away and the desperation I’ve seen for patients to obtain these drug is mad. ",0,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gwvb46/how_is_viking_therapeutics_inc_not_a_no_brainer/,research really beleive stock gold viking therapeutic shared update obesity treatment program vk obesityweek subject achieved mean weight loss baseline placeboadjusted weight loss day daily dosing mg far concerned believe effective mounjaro demonstrated average weight loss approximately starting body weight week treatment also oral vk demonstrated favorable safety profile adverse event classified mild moderate oral option could revolutionize weight loss treatment offering greater convenience let look subcutaneous vk resultor like dos weekly subcutaneous injection led weight reduction baseline treated patient achieved weight loss compared placebo weight loss progressive throughout study plateau week obesity drug market projected grow billion offering significant upside vk also important size market hold many multiple big player analyst also predict viking could become takeover target due strong pipeline would boost price digit whats company also received praise liver disease treatment vk showed positive result phase b trial mash metabolic dysfunctionassociated steatohepatitis serious liver condition affecting million american reduction liver fat ranging week response rate reduction high far exceed typical benchmark clinical data reinforce vks potential bestinclass obesity treatment effective weight loss strong safety durability result reason stock hasnt skyrocketed fear mongering market maker aftermath rfk junior far im concerned diabete liver disease go away desperation ive seen patient obtain drug mad,0.10976227795193311,Positive

stocks,"Qualcomm says it expects $4 billion in PC chip sales by 2029, as company gets traction beyond smartphones","Qualcomm said on Tuesday that it expects its push into new markets to generate an additional $22 billion per year by 2029.

Of that amount, roughly $4 billion will come from PC chips, Qualcomm said at its investor day on Tuesday. The chipmaker just introduced PC processors earlier this year, when it released Snapdragon X for Windows devices.

The latest forecast marks an important milestone for Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, who took over the company in 2021 with a promise to get past a reliance on smartphones. In fiscal 2024, Qualcomm’s handset business reported $24.86 billion in sales, about 75% of its entire chip business.

Qualcomm also said on Tuesday that automotive revenues would rise about 175% by 2029 to $8 billion, of which 80% is tied to contracts that have already been secured.

*″*We have been on this trajectory realizing that the technologies we have developed over the many years can be very relevant to a number of different industries beyond mobile,” Amon said at the investor event.

Another $4 billion in revenue will come from industrial chips and $2 billion will come from chips for headsets, a category Qualcomm calls XR. About $4 billion of the forecast is a catch-all for other chip sales, like those for wireless headphones and tablets.

Qualcomm shares are up 16% this year, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 26%.

Qualcomm grew rapidly over the past decade as its modems and processors became essential parts for high-end smartphones, especially those running Google Android. Qualcomm also sells modems and related parts to Apple for its iPhones.

But the company has warned investors that Apple could choose to stop buying Qualcomm parts as soon as 2027. Qualcomm said on Tuesday that its growing businesses will more than offset any losses from Apple.

Qualcomm’s strategy under Amon has been to use the technology its developed for its handset chips, like modems, processors, and AI accelerators, in new markets, including cars, PCs, and virtual reality. The investor event was the first time in years that the company has given a forecast for those new markets. Qualcomm said its total addressable market is as large as $900 billion.

“We put a strategy in ’21, and we’re not changing our strategy,” Amon said.

Laptop and desktop chips are currently dominated by Intel, which has over 70% percent of the market, according to Mercury Research. Intel reported $29 billion in PC chip sales in its 2023.

“The competitive landscape changed between the Windows and Macs,” Amon said, referring to Apple’s move in 2020 to switch from Intel to its own processors. “We saw that as an opportunity, especially as the ecosystem did not have confidence in the existing players to actually deliver a solution.”

The forecast for XR headsets also hints at the growth potential of the VR market over the next five years. Qualcomm supplies chips to many of the top headset makers, including Meta for its Quest and Ray-Bans products.

When it comes to artificial intelligence, Qualcomm calls itself an “edge AI” company, in contrast to cloud-based AI that’s typically powered by Nvidia processors. Company officials didn’t rule out introducing data center products in an interview with CNBC.

Qualcomm suggested that its mobile chips will be able to run the kind of advanced AI that’s restricted to large server farms today, an indication that that company may benefit from the AI boom down the road as the technology becomes more efficient.

“What you can run on the cloud last year, you can run on the device this year,” Durga Malladi, Qualcomm’s senior vice president in charge of planning, said at the event.

stocks,"Palantir short thesis and an analysis of its current earnings power, multiples and enterprise value","Hello friends. I hope you all spent your weekend counting the profit you made on your puts on friday. This is a long analysis with a position at the end. I will discuss Palantir and its recent explosion in share price, as well as their current earnings, multiples on said earnings and their enterprise value. I recognize that this is /r investing and thus short selling is not within everyone's risk profile. I hope it may also be of some value for those who are thinking of investing in palantir.

So here’s something you may have read somewhere: Palantir is on a meteoric rise and has made a lot of you good fellows fabulously wealthy (right…?). Since 2021 this stock has been a retail favorite and this is in large part for good reason. I’m not going to recap the business model here but the company has its foot in many o’ business  segments and has been bagging contracts left and right. They showed strong revenue growth, increasing margins (they turned GAAP profitable last year, a major milestone) and have enticed investors with promises of strong growth going forward. It is obviously a company that, for the right price, you want to be a part of.

Key phrase: *for the right price*. I am not allergic to growth investing and have often stomached high valuations if a company has an unrivaled business model and there is a strong enough runway for growth to eventually catch up with said high valuation. But I would like to make a case for Palantir being overvalued. In fact, the term overvalued does not even begin to scratch the surface of how incredibly bloated Palantir’s stock is.

For starters, let’s take into consideration palantir’s enterprise value. Despite the stock price rising roughly 50% versus its 2021 peak, Palantir’s enterprise value has ballooned much more.

*2021 peak enterprise value:* $60B at around $37 per share  
*17/11/2024 enterprise value:* $146B at around $64 per share

This is due to the increasing number of shares outstanding. In December 2020, Palantir had 978M shares outstanding. This has risen to 2.2 billion as of their most recent filing. While palantirs growth has certainly been impressive, it is worth looking at this in the context of their increased share count. Their revenue per share metrics have been the following.

End of 2020: *$1.12*  
2021: *$0.80*  
2022: *$0.92*  
*2*023: *$1.04*  
LTM: *$1.19* 

Palantir has only recently recaptured its revenue-per-share number that it had by the end of 2020. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it needs to be placed into the context of this being a perceived *growth* stock. Yes, revenue is increasing - but the amount of shares outstanding has historically kept pace with this revenue increase. As a shareholder, your claim on this revenue has historically not risen proportionally compared to its revenue growth.

Likewise, their profitability can also paint a distorted picture. Palantir adjusts the heck out of their earnings. If it is even at all possible to adjust it to paint a better picture, you better believe Karp & co will do so. Many of Palantirs shareholders are retail and cite the non-GAAP numbers as if they even remotely reflect reality. Their stock based compensation is obviously a massive expense and should be a huge red flag, but one of the most overlooked aspects I found is that of interest income. Palantir has a massive cash balance (gained through dilution - shocker, i know) that they invest in short term investments to gain interest income. This is of course nothing new, lots of companies do this. 

But consider this. In their last “blowout” quarter, Palantir gained $0.06 of GAAP EPS. This amounts to roughly $150M of net income, or about 1/1000th of their enterprise value. Of this number, $52M, or more than one third, was interest income. This is not a small footnote. Only $100M of their last quarterly earnings was actual, non-adjusted, no-nonsense operating income. Furthermore, they also paid only $7.8M of taxes on their income. This number is bound to increase over time as this is obviously a comically low tax rate. 

And then there is the valuation. Palantir trades at 55x EV / sales. This means that if *all* of Palantir’s revenue was after-tax profits and paid out as dividends, it would at their current revenues take until 2080 until investors recoup their investments. Their current EBIT margin is a little over 13%. That 55x number is mindblowingly expensive and it is almost impossible to come up with any scenario that doesnt require:

A) incredible and sustained growth in revenue

B) a steadily increasing margin, and

C) an unreasonably elevated market multiple and no collapse in overall stock market multiples for a long time

We all remember Stock McNealy’s (SUN microsystems CEO) iconic quote when he was reflecting on the dotcom bubble

*“At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?”*

This is somethine else entirely. 55 times sales is something that under almost no scenario can end well. Remember, you still need upside! It’s not just about justifying the current stock price, it’s about penciling out *enough upside* in the current stock price that would justify taking an extreme risk by holding this stock for an extended period of time. 

On friday, the stock market took a bath after roaring to new highs something like sixty times this year. Tesla, bitcoin and Palantir shrugged off the fear and continued to rise. Palantir added 11% and, with this move, added another five years of revenue to its elephant-sized market cap. This shows pretty clearly that Palantir is associated with meme-like risk assets. Who knows when the current market cap will reverse. It’s a game of liquidity. Musical chairs and all of the retail shareholders are playing. But one thing is clear: *their current EV / EBITDA is nearly 400x*. 

The amount of retail shareholders I see online that are convinced that this will go to $100 amazes me. My question is: Why? Based on what? Sure, it shoots up 5% a day and this leads everyone to believe it’s an amazing company. But long-term, this company has enormous shoes to fill. It is currently a penny masquerading as a $100 bill. Palantir holders are currently feasting on lobster and caviar but the bill will one day be due. And unless these guys accelerate their growth to 40% annually for a decade and increase their margins to Nvidia levels, there is only one way this ride will end. 

As it stands now, *all* of palantir’s equity is in the $5B cash position that they gained through dilution. Last quarter, the company earned $0.06 of GAAP EPS, of which $0.02 was interest income and only $0.04 was operating income. Aside from the $2 of equity per share, *all* of palantirs $65 share price is based on this $0.06 of earnings power and the future growth that the market is baking into this. In the future, growth will need to come from operating income as their cash position will not grow proportionally to keep 1/3rd of GAAP EPS in interest income. Their taxes will also go up in the future. If this is not a dotcom-level valuation, I do not know what is. 

If you currently buy a 10 year bond, you will net roughly 4.5% in interest annually. Palantirs stock nets you 1,8% - *in revenue!* 

All of this leads me to believe that this is a reasonable short opportunity. Thus, I am short for now, using graniteshares -3x Palantir (3SPA). The leveraged aspect of this product makes it vulnerable to decay if holding for long periods of time. Thus, I will look to acquire long-dated puts this week. Could get smoked some more, but that’s what makes a market.

stocks,"Sony is in talks to buy Kadokawa, media powerhouse behind 'Elden Ring'","NEW YORK/TOKYO, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Sony (6758.T), opens new tab is in talks to acquire Kadokawa (9468.T), opens new tab, the Japanese media powerhouse behind the “Elden Ring” game, two sources familiar with the matter said, as the technology giant looks to add to its entertainment portfolio.

The talks between the two sides are ongoing and, if successful, a deal could be signed in the coming weeks, the sources said.

Sony already has a 2% stake in Kadokawa and a stake in Kadokawa controlled FromSoftware, the developer of the hit fantasy action role-playing game.

Kadokawa is a huge player in Japan. I would say this is almost the equivalent of Disney buying Fox in the West. They’re not just the parent company behind ‘Elden Ring,’ they’re a anime, manga, light novel, and magazine publisher. They also produce and distribute anime and video games. They also have their hands in the music industry.

stocks,Okta - my analysis and thoughts,"I'd appreciate any and all feedback to see if I feel I'm on track or not and your perspective on my take. I know Okta took the hit after the social engineering ""hack"", but there's no doubt they're still the leader in the IAM space. I believe there's way more upside, but I also realize that they \*could\* be a serious M&A target.

**Executive Investment Summary: Okta, Inc.**

**Overview**

Okta, Inc. is a leading provider of identity and access management (IAM) solutions, serving enterprises globally with secure authentication systems. Its strong revenue growth, cash flow, and leadership in the cybersecurity market make it an attractive acquisition target.



***Key Financial Highlights***

\- Revenue (TTM): $2.45 billion, reflecting 16.2% YoY growth.

\- Profitability:

\- Net Income: -$136 million (improved from -$355 million YoY).

\- EBITDA: -$145 million.

\- Cash Flow Positive: Despite unprofitability, generating $607M in free cash flow.

\- Cash Position: $2.2 billion; current ratio of 1.83 (strong liquidity).

\- Debt Profile: $1.297 billion in total debt; net debt of $820 million (manageable).

\- Market Cap: \~$12–15 billion.

\- Valuation Multiples: Acquisition valuation estimated at $16–18 billion, reflecting 6–9x revenue multiples.



**Strategic Acquisition Rationale**



Market Opportunity

The IAM market is expanding due to hybrid work and zero-trust security models. Okta’s leadership in this high-demand space adds immediate value to acquirers.



Synergies

1. Revenue Synergies:

\- Cross-selling within SaaS, cloud, and cybersecurity ecosystems.

\- Increases customer retention via integrated security offerings.

2. Cost Synergies:

\- Consolidation of R&D, sales, and administrative functions.



**Tax Advantages**

1. Net Operating Losses (NOLs):

\- Okta’s significant NOLs can offset taxable income for the acquirer under U.S. tax rules (IRC Section 382), reducing the acquirer’s overall tax burden.

\- For cash-flow-positive acquirers like *Microsoft* or *Salesforce*, this could be an immediate financial benefit.

2. R&D Tax Credits:

\- Okta’s investment in IAM technology qualifies for R&D tax credits, which the acquirer can leverage to reduce tax liability.

3. Capital Gains Protection:

\- If the acquirer has large realized gains in 2024, purchasing Okta could offset these with acquisition-related costs.



Timing Considerations

2024: Lower valuation; earlier synergies and immediate tax benefits from NOLs.

2025: Higher valuation but lower operational risk as Okta achieves profitability milestones.



**Potential Acquirers and Recommendations**

Acquirer: Microsoft

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

Why? Integrates into Azure AD; removes a competitor; strengthens security leadership. Early acquisition maximizes synergies and tax advantages from Okta’s NOLs.



Acquirer: Google (Alphabet)

Timing Recommendation: Wait until 2025

Why? Conservative M&A approach; IAM complements Google Cloud; may prefer profitability first.



Acquirer: Amazon (AWS)

Timing Recommendation: Wait until 2025

Why? Less urgent; would act only if Microsoft or others make a move.



Acquirer: Salesforce

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

Why? Complements Slack and Salesforce’s SaaS stack; increases enterprise value. Tax advantages can offset acquisition costs while enhancing shareholder value.



Acquirer: Cisco

Timing Recommendation: Acquire in 2024

Why? Aligns with Cisco’s cybersecurity strategy; enhances subscription revenue growth. Okta’s NOLs can be applied against Cisco’s strong operating profits.



**Valuation and Stock Price Impact**



Acquisition Valuation

2024: $16–18 billion (20–40% premium).

2025: $18–22 billion, assuming profitability.



Stock Price Impact

2024 Acquisition:

\- Stock Price Range: $95.81–$107.78 per share.

\- Upside: +29% to +45% (from \~$74.51 current price).



2025 Acquisition:

\- Stock Price Range: $107–$130 per share.

\- Upside: +44% to +75%.



**Final Recommendation**



For Acquirers

2024 Acquisition:

\- Microsoft, Salesforce, Cisco: Act now to secure market share, synergies, and tax advantages while Okta is undervalued.



2025 Acquisition:

\- Google, Amazon: Wait for profitability milestones, reducing operational risks.



For Stockholders

Hold the stock for potential 29–75% upside over the next 12–18 months through organic growth or an acquisition.

**Conclusion**

Okta is a prime acquisition target with robust growth potential, strategic synergies, and significant tax advantages for tech giants. While aggressive acquirers like Microsoft, Salesforce, and Cisco should act in 2024 to maximize these benefits, more conservative companies like Google and Amazon may wait until 2025 for improved profitability metrics. Either way, Okta presents a compelling investment with projected stock price increases of $95–$130 per share.

stocks," UBER, Bright Future or Dim outlook?","UBER (Uber Technologies) has been beaten down quite a bit recently off the news that Donald Trump will make the barrier to entry for autonomous vehicles in the United States easier to get through, presumed from his newfound friendship with Elon Musk. Now relatively obviously UBER sold off quite a bit on this news, but I believe this isn't as bad as the market is making it out to be. I believe that Uber could easily survive mass adoptions of Autonomous Vehicles if they simply pivot to becoming the platform provider  this could be quite profitable for Uber and see their expenses come down greatly, as they no longer need to worry about paying for drivers. Uber currently sits at 4.10 FCF Yield (2.83% if you factor in SBC), and is growing FCF's at over a 100% YTD and Revenue 20% YTD. This is a rapidly growing company that's priced quite cheaply, and I believe that the downfall of UBER is greatly exagerated. If Uber can position themselves and continue their relationship with Waymo to be the platform provider, I think they're positioned very well for the adoption of Autonomous Vehicles.

stocks,Trying to understand the mechanics/risk of SGOV vs short term treasuries Money Market vs a HYSA and their relative safety.,"I recently have started using SGOV in my brokerage as a savings account which I pay my bills against to minimize idle cash in low returning accounts.  The returns are between 4.5-5.5% in the recent interest rate markets which is better than my High yield savings account (HYSA) so I basically have discontinued using my HYSA and just use SGOV.  I don't think I fully understand the risk after talking to a Schwab advisor so hoping to get some insight.  For comparison, here are 3 different yet similar investment vehicles that I am comparing:

1. SGOV: an ETF that is 99% invested in ultra short term treasuries; 30 day yield of 4.74%.  High liquidity as I can instantly buy/sell during market hours.  Share price increases throughout the month and then decreases on the 1st when they turn over their bonds and pay the difference in dividends.  Interest is 99% tax free at the state level due to Treasury holdings.
2. MM (SWSBX): a Schwab money market account; 30 day yield of 4.29%.  Schwab acts as middle man and fixes price at $1 per share, uses their resources to ensure stability during chaotic events.  Higher liquidity as money settles in 24 hrs.  Interest is paid directly to the account.  Interest is largely tax free at the state level due to holdings.
3. HYSA: a high yield savings account; 30 day yield of 4.65%.  Bank acts as a middle man with my money, investing it in Treasuries and Bonds and paying me a return.  Benefit: FDIC insurance.  Drawback: slow liquidity if I need to move money around quickly.  Interest is subject to State and Federal taxes.

The Schwab advisor was trying to say that SGOV is not negligible risk because it is an ETF so supply/demand sentiment can rapidly fluctuate the share price just like S&P500.  He said that this is because it is a closed end traded fund so it has a fixed number of shares that correspond to the projected value of the underlying bonds and therefore is sensitive to rapid shifts in buying and selling to balance the traded price.  Google says it is has an open ended structure same as the money market, so this already seems wrong.  I have noticed certain days I'll have a small (0.05%) loss although it does provide the anticipated 30day yield over the course of the month.  I assumed these minor losses were from buying/selling of the underlying bonds that have mismatched maturity intervals (1 weeks vs 4 week, etc).

It seems to me that there are the following risks:

1. Government / Treasury insolvency: if something like this happens it seems that all 3 of these vehicles are equally in trouble as well as FDIC insurance, so I'm not really concerned about this.
2. ETF Management Fraud: this seems like the main risk, if the SGOV board was committing fraud and not actually allocating 99% of its resources to treasuries.  The risk feels pretty low on this though but it would be unique to SGOV.
3. Return Rate Fluctuation:  If federal interest rates suddenly drop, it seems all 3 vehicles would be equally impacted although some maybe more quickly than others.  Therefore, I'm not really concerned about this either.  This also would only impact future returns not your principle.
4. Black Swan Event:  If something happened like war or pandemic outbreak and a massive shift in outflows occurred, what would happen?  Would SGOV plummet, MM be protected through Schwab backing, and HYSA be unaffected and protected with FDIC?  This is my primary concern.

TLDR:  Is it possible for SGOV return a negative value?  I understand its return is sensitive to underlying short term treasury bond prices but can you lose your principle?",12,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gvawfq/trying_to_understand_the_mechanicsrisk_of_sgov_vs/,recently started using sgov brokerage saving account pay bill minimize idle cash low returning account return recent interest rate market better high yield saving account hysa basically discontinued using hysa use sgov dont think fully understand risk talking schwab advisor hoping get insight comparison different yet similar investment vehicle comparing sgov etf invested ultra short term treasury day yield high liquidity instantly buysell market hour share price increase throughout month decrease st turn bond pay difference dividend interest tax free state level due treasury holding mm swsbx schwab money market account day yield schwab act middle man fix price per share us resource ensure stability chaotic event higher liquidity money settle hr interest paid directly account interest largely tax free state level due holding hysa high yield saving account day yield bank act middle man money investing treasury bond paying return benefit fdic insurance drawback slow liquidity need move money around quickly interest subject state federal tax schwab advisor trying say sgov negligible risk etf supplydemand sentiment rapidly fluctuate share price like sp said closed end traded fund fixed number share correspond projected value underlying bond therefore sensitive rapid shift buying selling balance traded price google say open ended structure money market already seems wrong noticed certain day ill small loss although provide anticipated day yield course month assumed minor loss buyingselling underlying bond mismatched maturity interval week v week etc seems following risk government treasury insolvency something like happens seems vehicle equally trouble well fdic insurance im really concerned etf management fraud seems like main risk sgov board committing fraud actually allocating resource treasury risk feel pretty low though would unique sgov return rate fluctuation federal interest rate suddenly drop seems vehicle would equally impacted although maybe quickly others therefore im really concerned either also would impact future return principle black swan event something happened like war pandemic outbreak massive shift outflow occurred would happen would sgov plummet mm protected schwab backing hysa unaffected protected fdic primary concern tldr possible sgov return negative value understand return sensitive underlying short term treasury bond price lose principle,0.04308625336927225,Positive

stocks,Super Micro hires new auditor to maintain Nasdaq listing; shares pop 23%,"Embattled server maker Super Micro Computer said on Monday that it’s hired BDO as its new auditor and submitted a plan to Nasdaq detailing its efforts to regain compliance with the exchange. The shares jumped 23% in extended trading.

“This is an important next step to bring our financial statements current, an effort we are pursuing with both diligence and urgency,” Super Micro CEO Charles Liang said in a statement.

Super Micro is late in filing its 2024 year-end report with the SEC, and said earlier this month that it was looking for a new accountant after its previous auditor, Ernst & Young, stepped down in October. Ernst & Young was new to the job, having just replaced Deloitte & Touche as Super Micro’s accounting firm in March 2023.

Super Micro said it told Nasdaq that it believes it will be able to file its annual report for the year ended June 30, and quarterly report for the period ended Sept. 30. The company said it will remain listed on the Nasdaq pending the exchange’s “review of the compliance plan.”

Shares of Super Micro soared more than twentyfold over a two year period from early 2022 until their peak in March of this year. But the stock has been hammered on troubling news about its compliance with Nasdaq. Once valued at about $70 billion, the company’s market cap was at $12.6 billion at the close on Monday, following a 16% rally during regular trading.

Super Micro has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence boom, due to its relationship with Nvidia. Sales last fiscal year more than doubled to $15 billion.

On Monday, Super Micro announced that it was selling products featuring Nvidia’s next-generation AI chip called Blackwell. The company competes with vendors like Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise in packaging up Nvidia AI chips for other companies to access.

Super Micro was added to the S&P 500 in March, reflecting its rapidly growing business and then-soaring stock price. Less than two weeks after the index changes were announced, Super Micro reached its closing high of $118.81.

The troubles began within months. In August, Super Micro said it wouldn’t file its annual report with the SEC on time. Noted short seller Hindenburg Research then disclosed a short position in the company, and said in a report that it identified “fresh evidence of accounting manipulation.” The Wall Street Journal later reported that the Department of Justice was at the early stages of a probe into the company.

The month after announcing its report delay, Super Micro said it had received a notification from the Nasdaq, indicating that the delay in the filing of its annual report meant the company wasn’t in compliance with the exchange’s listing rules. Super Micro said the Nasdaq’s rules allowed the company 60 days to file its report or submit a plan to regain compliance. Based on that timeframe, the deadline was Monday.

stocks,What your take on FMNA/FMCC?,"I just made a ton of money on FNMA since the end of the election. I know it’s a political play. 

Long story short. The 2008 housing crash left Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on the verge of bankruptcy, so they were put into government conservatorship. They received huge bailouts, which they have since paid back, but they remain under conservatorship today. 

They were trading almost 90 pps pre conservatorship then dropped to .20, now they’re up to 3.42 since the end of the election. I own 200k shares. So I’m invested financially and emotionally.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

stocks,Trading SPY for gains,"First time posting, long time lurking.

I had some money ($8k only) sitting at a HYSA and earning 4% interest.
Decided to buy $8k SPY and harvest profit on a day to day basis (meaning, if stock goes up, I withdraw gains. If it goes down, I do nothing).

My HYS was returning $25+ per month. I made $60 in 2 days. And kept $8k on SPY.

What am I missing here? Even if I stop now and don’t sell for the whole month, I still did better than HYSA. 

Are there tax implications (or complications) for realizing lots of micro short term gains? 
I believe the tax bracket of HYSA and short term gains is the same. 
Will my tax be too complicated to file if I keep doing these micro profit withdrawals?

Honestly, I am a new investor (trader?), have been doing index funds and NVDA for less than 1 year (401k solid, maxed out every year, for 8+ years)

$8k is the only around 10% of my liquid investment (not counting 401k, etc).

TSLA +5% overnight due to this news.

  
(Bloomberg) -- Members of President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team have told advisers they plan to make a federal framework for fully self-driving vehicles one of the Transportation Department’s priorities, according to people familiar with the matter.

If new rules enable cars without human controls, that would directly benefit Elon Musk, the Tesla Inc. chief executive officer and Trump mega-donor who has become a powerful fixture in the president-elect’s inner circle. He has bet the future of the EV maker on self-driving technology and artificial intelligence.

Current federal rules pose significant roadblocks for companies looking to deploy vehicles without steering wheels or foot pedals in large quantities, which Tesla plans to do. The Trump team is looking for policy leaders for the department to develop a framework to regulate self-driving vehicles, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly.

While the Transportation Department, through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, can issue rules that would make it easier to run autonomous vehicles, an act of Congress would clear the way for mass adoption of self-driving cars. A bipartisan legislative measure being discussed in early stages would create federal rules around AVs, two of the people said.

One candidate under consideration for Transportation secretary is Emil Michael, a former Uber Technologies Inc. executive who has spoken with Trump’s team and potential staffers, they said. The work is in its early stages and policy details have yet to be determined, they said. 

Republican Representatives Sam Graves of Missouri and Garret Graves of Louisiana have also been considered to lead the department, the people said.

The transition team didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Musk in October announced plans to produce large numbers of driverless Tesla robotaxis that lack driver controls starting in 2026. Current US regulations pose significant hurdles to Musk’s plans for the so-called Cybercab, including a cap limiting their deployment. 

He supported federal rules for autonomy on Tesla’s third-quarter earnings call, saying he’d use any role with the government to push for a process to allow autonomous vehicles to be used nationwide. The pronouncement prompted a selloff of shares of Uber and rival Lyft Inc.

Trump has since named Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency initiative to “dismantle government bureaucracy” and slash spending and regulations deemed overly burdensome.

Past efforts to come up with federal legislation to regulate autonomous vehicles have stumbled.

NHTSA currently permits manufacturers to deploy 2,500 self-driving vehicles per year under a granted exemption, but legislative efforts to increase that number to as many as 100,000 have repeatedly failed.

A bill to do that sailed through the House several years ago during Trump’s first term, but the measure has been bogged down in the Senate. An attempt during the first year of the Biden administration to merge the bill with other legislation faltered when some manufacturers tried to include language that would prevent consumers from suing or forming class-action cases.",279,67,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gtwjvx/trump_team_is_seeking_to_ease_us_rules_for/,tsla overnight due news bloomberg member presidentelect donald trump transition team told adviser plan make federal framework fully selfdriving vehicle one transportation department priority according people familiar matter new rule enable car without human control would directly benefit elon musk tesla inc chief executive officer trump megadonor become powerful fixture presidentelects inner circle bet future ev maker selfdriving technology artificial intelligence current federal rule pose significant roadblock company looking deploy vehicle without steering wheel foot pedal large quantity tesla plan trump team looking policy leader department develop framework regulate selfdriving vehicle according people familiar matter asked named werent authorized speak publicly transportation department national highway traffic safety administration issue rule would make easier run autonomous vehicle act congress would clear way mass adoption selfdriving car bipartisan legislative measure discussed early stage would create federal rule around av two people said one candidate consideration transportation secretary emil michael former uber technology inc executive spoken trump team potential staffer said work early stage policy detail yet determined said republican representative sam graf missouri garret graf louisiana also considered lead department people said transition team didnt respond request comment musk october announced plan produce large number driverless tesla robotaxis lack driver control starting current u regulation pose significant hurdle musk plan socalled cybercab including cap limiting deployment supported federal rule autonomy tesla thirdquarter earnings call saying hed use role government push process allow autonomous vehicle used nationwide pronouncement prompted selloff share uber rival lyft inc trump since named musk entrepreneur vivek ramaswamy lead new department government efficiency initiative dismantle government bureaucracy slash spending regulation deemed overly burdensome past effort come federal legislation regulate autonomous vehicle stumbled nhtsa currently permit manufacturer deploy selfdriving vehicle per year granted exemption legislative effort increase number many repeatedly failed bill sailed house several year ago trump first term measure bogged senate attempt first year biden administration merge bill legislation faltered manufacturer tried include language would prevent consumer suing forming classaction case,0.09789424860853432,Positive

My Due Diligence / Research for McDonald's Corporation (MCD)



**1. Fundamental Analysis:**

**a) Valuation:**

\- Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio: Currently at 25.5x, which is higher than the industry average of 23.2x, suggesting potential overvaluation.

\- Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio: At 8.2x, significantly higher than the industry average of 3.1x, indicating the stock may be priced too aggressively relative to its sales.



**b) Revenue Growth:**

\- McDonald's revenue growth has been sluggish in recent years, with a 5-year average growth rate of just 0.8%.

\- The company faces increasing competition from fast-casual dining options and changing consumer preferences toward healthier food choices.



**c) Margin Pressure:**

\- Rising labor costs and commodity prices are putting pressure on McDonald's profit margins.

\- The company's operating margin has remained relatively flat over the past few years, suggesting limited ability to improve profitability.



**d) Debt Levels:**

\- McDonald's has a high debt-to-equity ratio of 3.17, which is significantly above the industry average of 1.2.

\- This high leverage increases the company's financial risk and may limit its ability to invest in growth initiatives or weather economic downturns.



**e) Market Saturation:**

\- McDonald's has limited room for expansion in developed markets, where it already has a significant presence.

\- Growth in emerging markets may be challenging due to local competition and changing consumer preferences.



**2. Technical Analysis:**

**a) Trend Analysis:**

\- The stock has been in an uptrend for an extended period, potentially setting up for a reversal.

\- The 50-day moving average is showing signs of flattening, which could indicate a loss of momentum.



**b) Relative Strength Index (RSI):**

\- The RSI is currently near overbought territory (above 70), suggesting the stock may be due for a pullback.



**c) Volume Analysis:**

\- Recent trading volume has been below average, indicating a lack of conviction in the current uptrend.



**d) Support and Resistance:**

\- The stock is approaching a significant resistance level, which could act as a ceiling for further price appreciation.



**Conclusion:**



There are several factors  mentioned above, that suggest McDonald's stock (MCD) could be a potential short candidate:



1. The stock appears overvalued based on traditional valuation metrics.

2. The company faces challenges in revenue growth and margin expansion.

3. High debt levels increase financial risk.

4. Limited growth opportunities in developed markets and challenges in emerging markets.

5. Technical indicators suggest a potential trend reversal and loss of momentum.



However, it's important to note that McDonald's is a well-established company with a strong brand and global presence. Short positions carry inherent risks, and any trading decision should be made in the context of a well-diversified portfolio and with careful consideration of individual risk tolerance.

stocks,MCD and SOUN?,"https://careers.mcdonalds.com/director-ai-engineering/job/28631538

McDonald’s is ramping its AI efforts back up and all signs point to SoundHound AI as their next major partner. Their recent job posting for a Director of AI Engineering focuses on integrating Generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) into existing systems, rather than building proprietary solutions from scratch. This aligns perfectly with SoundHound’s expertise in conversational AI and their dominance in the foodservice sector. Notably, McDonald’s previously ended its AI collaboration with IBM, leaving room for a more specialized partner to enhance its drive-thru, kiosk, and mobile ordering systems.

Adding fuel to the speculation, SoundHound recently announced on their earnings call that they’ve secured a major new client in the restaurant industry—one they are not yet able to name and negotiating with others. Given McDonald’s history of partnering with established tech leaders like Dynamic Yield and the timing of this hiring, it’s hard not to connect the dots. If this is indeed a McDonald’s x SoundHound collaboration, it could mark a transformative leap forward in customer experience with cutting-edge conversational AI.

stocks,BioNTech Analysis and Questions ,"Let me first talk about the BioNTech's Q3 2024 Financial Results and some key intepretations I had:

There are some notable short term challenges, including

   * Decreased revenues from COVID-19 vaccines.
      * For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues were €1.56 billion, down from €2.34 billion in the same period in 2023
   * Net losses due to high R&D spending.
      * The company achieved a net profit of €198.1 million in Q3 2024, compared to €160.6 million in Q3 2023. However, for the first nine months of 2024, BioNTech reported a net loss of €924.8 million, a significant decrease from the €472.4 million net profit in the same period last year.
   * Uncertainties in clinical trial outcomes and regulatory approvals.
      * FDA placed a partial clinical hold on the Phase 3 NSCLC trial due to varying results.
      * The partial FDA clinical hold on BNT316/ONC-392 and the COVID-19-influenza combination vaccine not meeting all primary endpoints are notable challenges.

Now, there are many long term potencials:

* A robust and diverse pipeline with multiple candidates in late-stage trials.
   * Phase 1: 26 drugs currently in this stage; Phase 2: 13 drugs in this phase; Phase 3: 4 drugs in this final stage.
* Strong financial reserves to support ongoing development.
   * BioNTech maintains a strong cash position with €17.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and security investments as of September 30, 2024.
* Strategic shift towards high-growth areas like oncology and personalized medicine.
   * Initiated two Phase 2 trials in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
   * Planning Phase 3 trials based on Phase 2 outcomes.

stocks,Self driving is coming to your favourite cars,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to dive into Mobileye (MBLY) and its role in the self-driving car industry, especially concerning partnerships with major automakers. Let's break it down.

Company Overview:

Mobileye, a subsidiary of Intel, specializes in advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies. Their EyeQ® chips and software are integral to many vehicles' safety and automation features.

Key Partnerships:

Mobileye has secured collaborations with several major car manufacturers:

Volkswagen Group: In March 2024, Volkswagen announced a cooperation agreement with Mobileye to develop and supply software, hardware components, and digital maps for the self-driving ID. Buzz AD. 

Ford: Ford has integrated Mobileye's technology into its vehicles, enhancing their ADAS capabilities. 

Zeekr: The Chinese automaker Zeekr has collaborated with Mobileye to incorporate advanced driving technologies into its vehicles. 

Porsche: In May 2023, Porsche and Mobileye announced a collaboration to introduce Mobileye's SuperVision™ automated driver-assist functions in future Porsche sports cars. 


Recent Developments:

In November 2024, Lyft announced partnerships with Mobileye and other companies to integrate self-driving cars into its ride-hailing service. This collaboration aims to advance autonomous vehicle research and development, with plans to launch self-driving taxis in Atlanta next year. 

Financial Performance:

Mobileye's stock has experienced fluctuations. As of November 8, 2024, the stock price was $16.42. Analysts have mixed opinions, with some expressing concerns over growth prospects and competition. 

Future Outlook:

Mobileye's extensive partnerships position it as a significant player in the autonomous driving sector. However, the industry faces challenges, including regulatory hurdles, technological advancements, and competition from other tech companies and automakers developing in-house solutions.

Investment Considerations:

Investors should monitor Mobileye's ability to maintain and expand its partnerships, adapt to technological changes, and navigate the competitive landscape. The company's success in these areas will be crucial for its growth and profitability in the evolving autonomous vehicle market.

What are your thoughts on Mobileye's prospects in the self-driving car industry? Let's discuss!

Then, I would immediately purchase $47,000 in QQQ to avoid wash. 6% is mild correction territory, not a huge collapse, so I’d expect it to go back up soon after purchasing the QQQ and then I’m back to where I started plus $3k in negative capital gains to help my tax situation.

stocks,My research and direction of ABNB,"Hi Everyone,

Putting a disclaimer here before people come and flame me.

I am from the tech industry with a major in data modelling and have spent the last 15 years of my time trading, investing and sharing my research with my close circle of friends. Some picks bombed rightaway and my friends relying on my research lost a shitton of money, a very small portion were really good wins  but their overall portfolio indeed is still in the green.

So based on their push( and possibly for my validation too), I have decided to post my research here so that the wider community can support the research or find holes in it. Either way, this would help me make it better everytime. Also I trade as well as invest a lot via options, so at any point of time, I might be holding a long or a short position on the stocks I reseach.

I am based out of Melbourne, Australia and use IBKR and TastyTrade for trading in US markets.

I do technical analysis too but to be honest I do not rely on technical indicators much but rather  I rely on my data modeling background to find what the data is telling me. Whether a stock is overvalued, undervalued or worth its current evalation. None of the companies that I pick to trade(go long/short) are a quick trades. Usually my trades bear fruit in 3 to 4 months or sometime much longer. Hence I use the options way. No complex options techniques but just a simple call/put to enter with low capital and stay in longer than I could afford if I had gone the cash way.

I spent a lot of time last week evaluating AirBNB stock and my numbers show that its a short as stock which should keep on declining till the next results in Feb 2025. Then the numbers that come out in Feb 2025 should decide the fate from then onwards. Anything after that would be a speculation.

Based on my  analysis of Airbnb's financial performance, market position, and the industry trend I recommend a short position on ABNB stock. While the company has shown impressive growth and resilience, several factors suggest potential downside risk in the near to medium term.

As with any data modelling, I have also posted the risk of this analysis at the end as to why this modelling could fail and please read this in its entirety before you take any action. And please note, this is not financial advise but just my research based on me looking to take a position on a stock. Feel free to enter a long or short position based on what you infer from the data points below.

As for me, I would be entering a short position when the market opens today(18th Nov).

**Financial and Fundamental Analysis:**

**1. Valuation Concerns:**  
Airbnb's current valuation appears stretched, with a forward P/E ratio of approximately 35x (as of the last reporting date), significantly higher than the industry average. This premium valuation leaves little room for error and may not be sustainable in a challenging macroeconomic environment.

**2. Slowing Growth:**  
While Airbnb has demonstrated strong revenue growth since its IPO, the rate of growth is decelerating. Year-over-year revenue growth has slowed from triple-digit percentages in 2021 to more modest double-digit growth in recent quarters. This trend may continue as the company faces tougher year-over-year comparisons and market saturation in key regions.

**3. Regulatory Headwinds:**  
Airbnb continues to face regulatory challenges in various markets worldwide. Cities like New York, Barcelona, and Amsterdam have implemented stricter regulations on short-term rentals, which could impact Airbnb's inventory and revenue potential in these key markets.

**4. Increasing Competition:**  
The short-term rental market is becoming increasingly competitive, with traditional hotel chains expanding their offerings and new entrants like Vrbo (Expedia Group) gaining market share. This intensifying competition may pressure Airbnb's margins and market position.

**5. Macroeconomic Uncertainties:**  
The travel industry is sensitive to economic conditions. With concerns about inflation, potential recession, and geopolitical tensions, consumer discretionary spending on travel may decrease, negatively impacting Airbnb's bookings and revenue.

**6. Profitability Concerns:**  
While Airbnb has recently achieved profitability, its margins remain thin. The company's efforts to expand into new markets and services may put pressure on profitability in the short to medium term.

**Technical Analysis:**

**1. Bearish Trend:**  
The stock has been in a downtrend since its peak in February 2021, forming lower highs and lower lows. This suggests persistent selling pressure and a lack of sustained bullish momentum.

**2. Moving Average Crossover:**  
The 50-day moving average has recently crossed below the 200-day moving average, forming a ""death cross."" This bearish signal often precedes further downside in the stock price.

**3. Resistance Levels:**  
ABNB stock has consistently failed to break through key resistance levels, indicating strong selling pressure at higher prices.

**4. Relative Strength Index (RSI):**  
The RSI has been trending downward and has struggled to break above the 60 level in recent months, suggesting weakness in buying momentum.

**5. Volume Analysis:**  
Recent rallies have occurred on relatively low volume, while sell-offs have seen higher volume. This pattern suggests that selling pressure remains dominant.

**Risks to Short Thesis:**

**1. Innovation and New Revenue Streams:**  
Airbnb's continued focus on product innovation and expansion into new services could drive unexpected growth and improve investor sentiment.

**2. Travel Industry Recovery:**  
A stronger-than-expected rebound in global travel could boost Airbnb's bookings and revenue, potentially leading to positive earnings surprises.

**3. Margin Improvement:**  
If Airbnb can significantly improve its operating margins through cost-cutting measures or increased efficiency, it could lead to better-than-expected profitability.

**Conclusion:**  
While Airbnb remains a leader in the short-term rental market with a strong brand and global presence, the combination of stretched valuation, slowing growth, regulatory challenges, and bearish technical indicators suggests potential downside risk. I would be initiating a short position in ABNB stock using either a March or April 2025 PUT option, with close monitoring of the identified risks to the short thesis.

investing,Switzerland Equities for Diversification Amidst Geopolitical Uncertainty ,"The MSCI Switzerland ETF (EWL) is quite interesting. It has a low correlation with U.S. equities. I created a correlation matrix on Macroaxis.com between domestic indexes and some international equities indexes, EWL and SPY has a correlation of -0.73, which is among one of the lowest. 
EWL’s historical annualized return since inception is quite close to that of the S&P 500 (S&P 500: 7.70%; Switzerland: 7.10%). 
The top three sectors by weighting are relatively conservative—healthcare, financials, and consumer staples, which is quite conservative. 
Additionally, its price-to-earnings ratio (17.60) is significantly lower than that of the S&P 500 (29.75).

investing,New Investissement Strategy I’m working on,"ECFA: The Cumulative Fund Growth Strategy

Objective: Maximize monthly dividend generation through a diversified portfolio, reinvest dividends, and maintain a cash reserve to mitigate risks and ensure contributor payments.

1. Strategy Composition

Distribution of Initial Capital

	•	85% in Dividend-Producing Assets: A diversified mix of high-quality assets that generate monthly dividends.
	•	15% in Safe Assets: Investments in low-risk, stable products like bonds or other conservative funds.

Asset Allocation (85% of Initial Capital)

	1.	Real Estate Investment: A portion of the portfolio is allocated to real estate-based assets known for regular dividend payouts.
	2.	Energy Sector: Another portion is invested in energy infrastructure, providing reliable income through dividends.
	3.	Healthcare: Investments in healthcare-related assets that offer consistent returns.
	4.	Technology/Telecom: A selection of technology and telecom assets providing monthly dividends.
	5.	Industrial Assets: A portion is invested in industrial sectors known for stable and predictable dividend payments.

2. Cash Reserve

	•	Capital Allocated: 500 CAD
	•	Interest: Generates 2.25% annual interest.
	•	Purpose: The reserve is used solely for paying monthly interest to contributors, maintaining the stability of the strategy.

3. Contributors

	•	One-Time Loan: Each contributor provides a fixed amount per period.
	•	Interest Rate: Contributors receive 10% annual interest, paid monthly from the cash reserve.
	•	Repayment: Contributors are repaid at the end of the agreed period, either through stock sales or reinvested dividends.

4. Dividend Reinvestment

	•	Goal: To maximize long-term growth.
	•	Process: All dividends generated are reinvested into the portfolio, increasing the capital base and generating more monthly income.

5. Potential Gains from Asset Sales

	•	If needed, assets can be sold to ensure payments to contributors.
	•	Surplus: Gains from asset sales are used to cover interest payments or repaying contributors without affecting the strategy’s growth.

6. Benefits of ECFA Strategy

	•	Stable Dividend Income: A diversified portfolio with monthly dividend payouts.
	•	Scalable: The strategy grows with more contributors, increasing the overall dividend income.
	•	Risk Diversification: Combining high-yield assets with safe investments reduces market risk.
	•	Flexibility: The cash reserve ensures contributor payments, even in volatile market conditions.

7. Risks

	•	Market Risk: Asset values can fluctuate, impacting the performance of the strategy.
	•	Liquidity Risk: The need to sell assets in volatile markets could result in lower-than-expected returns.
	•	Contributor Risk: If contributors withdraw early or dividends underperform, the payment schedule could be affected.

8. ECFA Strategy Rating

	•	Profitability: 9/10
	•	Risk: 7/10
	•	Scalability: 8/10

Overall Rating: 8/10

investing,"Stocks to buy to mimic index, so I can close down my SMA","US citizen here, who moved to Denmark a couple of years ago. When I was in the US, I just invested directly in ETFs. Denmark has mark to market taxation on ETFs/Mutual Funds so before moving I liquidated my ETFs and set-up SMAs through JP Morgan. 

The active nature of SMAs is resulting in significant realised capital gains (for which I owe the Danish govt 42%.) My goal for this portfolio is wealth creation and ideally I'd like to buy and hold and not experience capital gains for the next 3-4 years while I'm in Denmark. Denmark doesn't tax stock holdings from a mark to market perspective, like they do ETFs/MFs.

With that background, a few questions

\- I need to work through the math, but unless my SMA is significantly outperforming the index, I don't see why its beneficial for me to go with an actively managed portfolio. Does that sound right? I need to figure out the breakeven point

\- I'd like to try and get close to mimic-ing the index, by buying stocks directly and just holding them vs. actively managing the portfolio. Can I just buy 30-50 stocks across the globe and then just hold to get close to the index? Are there tools I can use to mimic this? 

I'm willing to give up some of the gains by using this strategy, vs. realising gains and paying substantial taxes. What else am I missing? Would appreciate further thoughts on this front. Thanks so much.

investing,Revolut allows crowdfunders to cash out for 78x returns,"£80K FROM A £1K INVESTMENTI recently posted about two bits of news related to Revolut:1.

That they’re doing ANOTHER Secondary Sale this year 2. That they’re embroiled in a legal battle with Republic

The legal battle arose as Jamba Europe, a private equity firm, agreed to purchase 10,000 Revolut shares from 225 investors for £4.5m in a secondary sale via republic at the start of November.

This was at a share price roughly 30% lower than Revolut’s latest $45bn valuation.However, Revolut tried to block this sale by changing its articles of association, which Republic believed was against the law in a turn of events Revolut is now allowing Republic shareholders to sell £9m worth of shares at the £675 share price (i.e. the $45bn valuation).

The original share price on Republic was £8.57 meaning investors will make an insane 78x return.£1k invested would now be worth almost £79k 🤯 .

This is amazing news for the crowdfunders who are now able to sell more shares at a higher valuation, while also enabling Revolut to maintain their valuation.Well played Revolut 👏.

investing,Does this strategy make sense,"Currently my portfolio is 70% VOO and 30% SGOV. Before last week I was 100% VOO. But like many others I feel the chance of a significant drop (over 20%) in the next year could happen. Not saying it’s guaranteed to happen. Wild guess is about a 30% chance of a 15%+ drop in 2025.

Another factor is I’m a few years away from retirement. 

Here is the strategy I plan on implementing. At the current market sentiment I will keep my portfolio at 70/30 stock. Almost all of my portfolio is in IRA/Roth. So buying and selling won’t cause a taxable event.

If stocks continue to go up I will sell some VOO and buy SGOV so my ratio stays at 70/30

If stocks drop 10% - I will sell some SGOV and buy VOO so my allocation is 80/20

If stocks drop more to 20% - I will sell some SGOV and buy VOO so my allocation is 90/10

If stocks drop more to 30% - I will sell some SGOV and buy VOO so my allocation is 100/0

I could adjust this to be more conservative (wait to buy till 20% drop) but I’m not hunting the bottom. I just want to be able to buy VOO at a discount if a 10-30% drop happens. If it drops more to 40-50% then fine. But probability shows it is much more likely it will drop 10-30%.

Does this strategy make sense? I’m not trying to maximize growth (100% stock) or trying to time the bottom (wait till full 30-50% drop to buy VOO)

Or am I trying to time the market too much. I will say if I retire in 5 years and I’m 100% stock, it would suck if the market drops 40% that year.

investing,Looking for papers/books written BY Jim Simons - help me find his published work,"I'm trying to find academic papers, books, or other publications that Jim Simons himself wrote throughout his career. I know he was a brilliant mathematician before founding Renaissance Technologies, but I'm having trouble tracking down his actual written work.

* His mathematical papers from his academic career
* Any articles he's written about trading or markets
* Published lectures or speeches
* His doctoral thesis
* Any other written material where he's the primary author

If anyone has links to his publications or knows where to find them, I'd really appreciate it. Even if the math goes over my head, I think it would be fascinating to read his actual work rather than just books about him.

My company offers ESPP with RSU match instead of a discount that vests immediately upon grant. The company stock price swings are very volatile DoD and even MoM (talking about 5% swings daily, double digit swings in L6M etc. The stock has been at a long term downtrend and recently is seeing a potential reversal due to company finally being profitable for the first time.

Even with the 20% RSU, this seems like a huge gamble due to the volatility of the stock, and I may be better off putting this into a HYSA or even an index fund, but I wanted your take to see if I might be missing anything.

investing,Long Calls: Strike Points and Premiums,"Hi All,

I am new to options trading. I got involved with LUNR and ACHR (long calls) and have made some decent money. Here are my questions:

\- Only involved with long calls, typically 2-4 weeks.

\- I typically never exercise my option to purchase shares. Only interested in buying a contract and then selling when I see >200% total ROI  
\- Is it common to sell these options before the strike price on the contract has been hit?

\- If my plan is to just buy a contract (in anticipation that the stock will rise) and then sell the contract a week or two later for profit, is it better to buy:

1. Longer-dated options with high strike prices and low premiums
2. shorter-dated options with high strike prices and low premiums
3. Loner-dated options with lower strike prices and high premiums
4. shorter-dated options with lower strike prices and high premiums

\- Additionally, is it true that if I buy a contract and the underlying stock price increases by as little as 1%, my contract is already worth more, regardless of the strike price i chose?

investing,Did I make a bad decision switching my investments in my 401k?,So I was automatically enrolled in the 401k at work and I have been trying to learn more about it. It automatically put me int a state street target date fund. Looking at the other options and reading what most people say it seemed like I would be better off with the S&P 500 State Street fund so I switched to 85% of future contributions going to that and 15% to the tdf. It has a lower expense ratio of .02 instead of .09 and better returns over every time period shown. Then I was reading about how that is probably redundant because the tdf also has S&P 500 in there already. So I found a mid cap fidelity fund with a .025 expense ratio and better returns over every period shown than the tdf and switched so the 15% going the the tdf would now go to fid mid cap. After both these changes I read things making me question my decision. One was somebody saying they don't know why anyone would ever invest in mid cap lol. I was thinking about changing it to 80% S&P 500 10% fid mid cap and 10% small cap. I don't know if that is better. My thought was just that the S&P 500 and mid cap have lower expense ratios and better returns over recent years so it seemed like a good idea.

investing,Should I cash out my 401K to invest elsewhere?,"Money would solve literally all of my problems

So here's the stitch:
  
I've always been good with what little money I've had, but my toxic habit is hanging onto it in my savings accounts because I never had enough to invest and let go of long enough to accrue any interest or growth (i.e. paycheck to paycheck life & on my own since 16). I always needed an emergency fund, which would be depleted ever couple of years during a crisis. Despite this, my credit has taken a massive hit due to some poor decisions, and I am finding it almost impossible to recover from, even if I paid off all of my debt, which would leave me with no safety net.

  
I've had a corporate job for nearly 3 years now, which comes with a 401K. At first, I was only contributing 5% because that's as much as my employer was matching. They stopped matching for about a year, then started back up again this past July. So my return is currently around +17% with a high risk profile. 

It occurred to me recently that this is all pre-tax contributions, and while I'd take home less if I contributed more, my untaxed savings would grow exponentially while I was taxed less on lesser take home pay.

  
I've accrued nearly $14k in my time with the company and recently changed my contributions to 10%. However, I am seeking a way to cash it out and put it somewhere where it will double, triple, whatever in a shorter period of time, and I am willing to take the 10% tax penalty to do so - if it's worth it.

So my question to you savvy investor members is - have you ever cashed out your 401K, and what did you do with it in order to have your money make you more money? Possibly even navigating the economy in such a way that your money ended up working for you so well that you were able to retire on a passive income.

  
Is this possible? Do I have enough to do something like that? What are your suggestions? Should I roll it over? Are there opportunities I am unaware of and missing out on?

investing,Is my bond ladder allocation okay?,"I personally don't like investing in bond funds. That's because they gain or lose value based on the current intetest rate, hence, I don't feel too much safe with them. I don't know if it makes sense tho, it's my personal view.

The allocation I was thinking about would serve the following points
* Being an hedge against my stocks ETF in the (rare) case I need to pull out my money from my portfolio despite I have an emergency fund too. In this case I will have the freedom to choose what I want to sell
* Having a small, but non-zero appreciation of my capital.

Being 100 the value of the intended allocation to bonds what I thought is
* 33 for 0-2y maturity bonds which could be covered with a money market ETF
* 33 for 2-5y maturity bonds
* 33 for 5-10y maturity bonds

I think this allocation grants me increasing exposure to mid/long term bonds which are historically decorrelated to stocks. I will also have exposure to short term bonds which are not volatile.

I plan to rebalance every one or two years, diversifying over a couple of countries (I live in Europe so I can choose several countries paying in Euro).

investing,Thoughts on Tesla in December,"So right after Tesla recently reached it's ath I made the decision to short it and I made some decent returns on that but already closed the position as Ibfelt like it was done with it's current correction.

But I still think the company is very overvalued. I would think 250 is a fair value or maybe even less. 

Let's be honest the overvaluation is due to people having strong feeling for Elon Musk not bcs the company has an economic moat.

So the question we need to ask ourselves is: will the postive sentiment end at any point in the near future and honestly I do not think so. Bunch of recent tweets were pretty controversial and all that but I feel like this won't have any further impact atm. I just read they are recently started production on the newest Y model and it's supposed to be available in early 2025 so this might actually push the price up until then.

investing,A Second or Third Revisit of Why Warren Buffet May Not Have Fully Understood TSLA When He Said Value is Equivalent to the Whole Car Industry,"Hi investment friends, starting with the point of this analysis: Tesla, is a Wrigley's or a Coca Cola or our era but with a beyond imagining more future potential. 

Warren Buffett's although we love him, he's one of the top 7 wisest who ever lived and has the motto ""invest in things you understand"" (it should be added that there should at least be ample time to get to understand it coz' most are very much understandable or it's just pride to stick to simple to manufacturer but en masse consumables and the like as I call his favorites, assets like gum, candy, airlines and softdrinks which are everywhere and all customers are repeat customers) but there's still that constant, that he's not infallible. What it means to 'understand' has to be truly be analyzed way deeply than ever before.

As most have said in the tech industry, sir Warren's fundamental which includes that it's highly speculative (also it's not on the record but it implies he's not into Elon Musk's kind of personality which for him is unpredictable but that's another miss in the fundamental analysis of the one who leads Tesla) analysis of Tesla appears not to be fundamental at all coz' it's most likely incomplete. As most have said Tesla is not just a car company, it's not just a products company selling cars. What was once speculative and beyond the norm have materialized, an example is EV cars that are practical compared to EVs from generations past, now you have the many Models of Tesla. Elon Musk w/ Tesla has proof that they can execute what seems to be many as speculative (although I don't agree with him 100%, especially when it comes to 100% autonomy, coz' technology is buy a tool for mankind and will always babysit any technology).

Tesla is not just a car company, it's more than that- its an energy company (generating revenues energy services like charging and at the same time it ""ate it's own cake too"" as they say, it creates the products, the batteries to facilities that energy charging service), it's an A.I. company, solar energy company and a robotics company which is still at a speculation stage wether people will buy that but given Tesla w/ Elon's leadership, there's a high probability that Optimus will be practically used almost everywhere (just like again, EV as practical long range modes of transportation was a pipe dream until they launched en masse the Model S and the Models after that).

investing,Is there any point investing in anything other than US equities?,"US equities has always been the largest part of my portfolio (about 50-60%). I'm looking at the bizarre market though and wondering why the hell I would invest in anything else for the foreseeable? I can't remember my exact distributions, but the rest of my portfolio is more or less equally split between equities in UK, Emerging Markets, EU, Japan, Asia (excluding Japan), and I think a small portion for Africa. My thinking is that I'm investing with a 40+ year time horizon (I'm 28), and if any one of those areas sees outsized returns it could mean a lot. Likewise there's also a case of not wanting to put all my eggs in one basket.

When looking at returns the US alone is either double or triple the rest of them though, so even if the returns halved overnight they'd still be on top. Meanwhile a small downturn in the other markets could practically wipe out all their gains.

Looking at my returns in total for the last 3 years I believe I've averaged something like 13% yearly.

So should I just stay the course and ignore any potential 'lost' growth, or go all in on the US?

investing,Tax-Optimized Investing - IRA vs ROTH IRA,"Was reviewing account allocations of my managed accounts today and saw something I found ""weird"" and wanted to get the opinion of others...

When choosing where to invest funds in an IRA vs a ROTH IRA, what account would you prioritize for bonds vs stocks?

Hypothetically, lets say you have $100k to invest split evenly between ROTH and Traditional IRA.

You have a broad target allocation of 70/30 stocks-to-bonds so you're looking to buy $30k in bonds.

Would you:

A) Keep allocations the same 70/30 across the board splitting the $30k total bond investment equally, $15k, between tIRA/rIRA with stocks making up the other $35k in each account

B) Optimize towards more bonds in the Traditional IRA (60/40) and stocks in the ROTH IRA (80/20) splitting the $30k total bond investment $20k tIRA and $10k rIRA with stocks making up the other $30k in the tIRA and 40k in the rIRA

C) Optimize towards stocks in the Traditional IRA (80/20) and more towards bonds in the ROTH IRA (60/40) splitting the $30k total bond investment $10k tIRA and $20k rIRA with stocks making up the other $40k in the tIRA and $30k in the rIRA.

My managed accounts are currently optimized towards C and I'm of the opinion B is a better option since the stocks tend to be higher growth.

investing,Why wouldn't I invest heavily in gold?,"Asking as a legitimate question as I my knowledge on trading in general is quite limited. This year of very strong performance notwithstanding, I'm looking at the charts and struggling to find any point at which gold would not have yielded a solid and reasonably low risk return over the last 25 years over a 3-4 year investment period.

With the exception of the drop off in mid 2012 (recovered by 2014) there havnt been any significant price falls in that period. The returns over the last 2-3 would have been in the same region as the S&P500 and with commodities taxed at a lower rate than ETFs where I live the difference in net profits would be minimal, this with a added benefit of security it gives in balancing other assets during market uncertainty.

What am I missing? Because the temptation to drop a few grand into gold rather than it sitting in the bank account withering away is nawing at me.

investing,Talking with my dad about Nvidia over Thanksgiving,"My dad is an active investor, has been for decades and we talk about stocks and companies around the holidays. Yesterday we were talking about Nvidia and in our conversation there was something about AI and Nvidia and that he didn't know that I thought was common knowledge, but I'm curious how common it actually is or if it's a generational gap.

The knowledge that I thought was common was that the biggest reason Nvidia is well positioned to benefit from spending on AI is that graphics algorithms (e.g. video games, CGI rendering, etc.) and machine learning algorithms rely on the same kind of computation, large matrix multiplication. They have spent decades developing GPUs for graphics processing + other stuff, but through no effort on their own, the ""other stuff"" is now more valuable than the graphics processing. Their ""AI hardware"" is really just the most recent version of their GPUs that they sold to consumers, to Pixar, etc. not similar, they are \*literally\* the same thing.

They didn't somehow develop AI hardware in the past 2 years that's better than everybody else's, they've been developing the product for decades for another purpose and stumbled into the AI use case. This is also why it's so hard for a competitor to overtake them, they have a lot of ground to catch up on. Hardware development is really slow, really expensive and really difficult.

This came up in the context of my dad telling me some rumor he had heard about an ex-Nvidia current-Tesla engineer saying something about how Tesla had hardware that was years ahead of Nvidia, which is not really even remotely likely IMHO. Google has spent almost 10 years developing its TPUs for machine learning specifically and even then they're only faster in some narrow scenarios and is way more restrictive computationally.

As to why Nvidia and not AMD, it's largely because of their software stack and community support. They have put a lot of effort into developing CUDA, cuDNN, etc. and putting it in the hands of researchers starting 10+ years ago, so now it's what everybody builds on.

Before all the arm-chair experts come out of the woodwork, yes I know that GPUs are general purpose parallel processing units, but the point is that they have long been designed with graphics in mind first and foremost. And I know that they've been tailoring recent generations of GPUs more towards ML use-cases (e.g. tensor-cores) and they're not exactly like GPUs of old. And yes I know that their data-center business has long been a big portion of their revenue and they make more than just consumer graphics cards.

I don't mean to discount their good work, they've done a great job in positioning themselves in the best way possible, there is a lot to be said about being able to capitalize on good luck.

investing,30% Down Investment Strategy,"Hiya!

For about half of my portfolio, I use an investment strategy that seems to be working pretty well!

I call it the 30% off plan (but that is just an average).

Basically, I look for big companies that pay dividends and have dropped around 30% or more in the past 5 years.

(This does not include companies that pay crazy-high dividends).

This has worked out really well. Here's a few examples:

* MMM (started buying at $80).
* VFC (got in at $13 got out at $21).
* INTC (got in at $25 and out at $45).
* PFE (still piling into PFE).

I typically keep a few shares instead of selling the whole position.

I would also like to point out that I allocate a good portion of my portfolio to bonds and ETFs, so I'm not risking all my cash on this strategy.

Do y'all think this is an effective investment strategy?

investing,Why Healthcare sector is an “Overweight” for me,"
Healthcare Sector Underperformance:
Despite the S&P 500 gaining nearly 5% in November, healthcare stocks have lagged. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLV) is down 2% this month. While healthcare stocks face near-term policy uncertainty, long-term growth and undervaluation make them a potentially lucrative investment.
Donald Trump’s nomination of healthcare skeptics, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to key positions has heightened investor concerns. Skepticism surrounds potential changes in vaccine policies and regulations, creating uncertainty. Yet, established protocols and institutional inertia within agencies like the FDA and CDC may limit the extent of changes he can implement. Career officials and existing regulations could act as checks on drastic policy shifts. Significant policy changes, especially those affecting public health, could face legal challenges and public opposition, potentially delaying or blocking implementation.
While Kennedy’s nomination signals potential shifts in healthcare policies, the actual impact will depend on several factors, including the confirmation process, institutional checks, and public response. If confirmed, his influence could be substantial, particularly in areas aligning with his long-held views. However, systemic constraints and potential opposition may moderate the extent of his impact.
Healthcare stocks are trading at a valuation of 17.8x forward earnings, lower than the August level of 19.9x, representing the cheapest levels of the year. Analysts suggest this may present an attractive entry point if regulatory fears subside.
Healthcare fundamentals remain strong, with revenue growth expected to climb 11% in the next year. Margins are in the 93rd percentile historically, signaling robust performance relative to other sectors.

investing,$UMAC: figuring FMV and the future of warfare,"Last Saturday, Fox prints this piece.  [https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-scrambles-drones-shape-landscape-war-future-here](https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-scrambles-drones-shape-landscape-war-future-here)

Then on Sunday, Elon tweets this [https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1860574377013838033](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1860574377013838033)

Then on Wednesday, it is announced that Don Jr joins the board of UMAC here [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/27/unusual-machines-shares-soar-donald-trump-jr-joins-advisory-board.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/27/unusual-machines-shares-soar-donald-trump-jr-joins-advisory-board.html)

So what the hell is UMAC (Unusual Machines).  It is an absolutely tiny non-factor of a consumer drone maker located in a warehouse in Orlando.  Prior to the election, it had a flatlining stock trading around $1.50 and a market cap around $12M.  Then post election, the stock began rising suddenly with a number of large insider purchases.  Then with the announcement of Don Jr, the stock has soared to near $20 and a market cap of around $150M.  What's the hidden agenda.

Well, Don Jr. is a smart (i.e. opportunistic) man.  The war in Ukraine has shown the world that land wars are obsolete.  Your $10M Abrams tank can be neutralized by a single drone and a grenade that costs less than $500.  Infantrymen are obsolete.  They can be hunted mercilessly 24 hours a day by drones, day and night, rain or shine, in the trenches, in holes and tunnels, around corners, remotely using thermal vision.

Drones can only be defended by physical means (basically AI controlled counter-drones and bulelts).  Electronic jamming can be effectively countered with electronic shielding.  See this excellent video by Mark Rober.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrGENEXocJU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrGENEXocJU)

Drones are the future of warfare.  We will not need people.  We will not need bombers.  We just need someone with a suitcase of drones able to infiltrate within a few miles of a desired target, release a couple drones with explosives, and the target is wiped out.  No need to send in a $2B B-2 bomber equipped with a $250M worth of bombs to take out the target.  $20,000 of drones in a suitcase will suffice.  Imagine also if that suitcase can lay their dormant and be opened remotely as needed to strike any target in the area.

Drone warfare and terrorist strikes are coming to a place near you.  Sadly.

Lastly, the US DoD spends nearly $2T a year ($1.99T to be more exact).  This is clearly a level which is unsustainable, especially with the rising cost of debt service (yes, the Fed will need to engage in QE3 or 4 or 5 to prevent federal insolvency).  Spending cuts will need to happen.  And DoD with its bloated, irrational spending will be the primary targets.  It has to be.

You see, the Trump administration is dismantling the entire NeoCon apparatus.  Elon and Vivek, along with JD and Hegseth (maybe) and Tulsi and RFK2 (the Trump Avengers) are all zealots of the anti-establishment, anti-neocon, anti-war agenda.  I will bet you a nickle that they will chop trillions (as Vivek targeted $2T) in federal spending, starting with Elon's target the F-35.  Military strategy will evolve from enormously expensive concentrated single pieces of power (F-35, aircraft carriers, B-2, Abrams) to inexpensive fleets of cheap drones a la the Nova Corp.  [https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Nova\_Corps?file=NovaCorpsInBattle.png](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Nova_Corps?file=NovaCorpsInBattle.png)

These drones are nearly indefensible.  And they will be controlled by AI (buy NVDA).  This is the future of war.  And probably the doom of civilization.  It will not be AI that kills us off.  We won't make it that far.  Rather, we will kill ourselves off using AI-controlled drones to fight our wars.  The country with the smartest, fastest, and most drones wins.  We can strike every nuke silo simultaneously and defend our cities and facilities with a dome of drones.  The US not only has to defend its soil, but also that of its allies across the world.  It is hard to imagine how many drones the US military will need.  But lets try.

It is estimated that Ukraine is using 10,000 drones a month.  That is 300 a day.  This just on a small battlefield (only a 600 mile front-line!), capacity constrained military, using Generation 1 human-operated drone tactics.  Imagine having to defends tens of thousand critical facilities across the world at all times from a terrorist attack.  Imagine having to be prepared to fight a Drone World War all run by AI.  These systems would be able to control thousands of drones at a time.  We are talking many millions of drones for basic readiness (all operated by NVDA-driven AI).

So lets say the US military will prepare to fight a war globally on a front that is 100X the 600-mile front in Ukraine.  This may be low given the literally thousands of targets it will need to defend.  The battlefield is not contiguous.  And lets say AI war will use 50X (definitely low) the drones of human-operated war.  This is a 50M standing-army of drones required for defense (10,000 x 100 x 50).  That is for just 1 month of war.  Let's say the US military needs an 18-month stockpile.  That is 900M drones, lets call it 1B to simplify the math.  At say $200 per drone, that will cost $200B (about the cost of 2.5 F-35s to put that in perspective).

Lets say there is an attrition rate of 20% per year due to training and replacement (5-year life expectancy).  That is 250M replacement drones needed per year.  That is $50B for replacement drones.

This is SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than developing and maintaining high-tech weapon systems and soldiers.  The savings you can achieve by reducing the number of infantry and high tech jets and ships and tanks, replacing them with drones are massive.  Enough to bail out the US federal debt!  Sure this change won't happen overnight, but it is happenings as we speak thanks to Ukraine.

So what does this all have to do with UMAC?  Well, it is perfectly positioned to ride the wave of this coming military revolution.  It has the anti-neocon son of the future president on its advisory board and from what I can tell, he is also a very significant shareholder in the company.  There is no way this deal was just put together in the past few weeks.  It had to be in the works for months subject to Trump winning the election.  Which then triggered new stock issuance by UMAC, DonJr's investment, and his ascension to the board.

The CEO of UMAC is a guy named Allan Evans.  You can hear him here back in July 2024 talking about focusing on military contracts and the need for NDAA-complaint manufacturers.  They are focusing on being an NDAA-compliant parts supplier to the drone market.  These guys know they can't make the sophisticated AI drones that the military will need.  But they sure as hell can supply the drone parts.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAQjqQyyCzQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAQjqQyyCzQ)

At a $150M market cap, this thing is ridiculously underpriced relative to where it should be after proper hyping.  I think the market is still trying to figure it out.  You can't value it on current fundamentals.  It is just the shell company for DonJr (and thereby Trump) to profit off the coming drone military revolution.  Just like Truth Social was/is for DonSr.  The future of drone warfare has arrived.  UMAC is positioned as the domestic NDAA-compliant part supplier.  With DonJr, it is the supplier of choice.  I don't know if there is another NDAA-compliant drone parts supplier out there (probably not given that it's mostly all been made thus far in China), UMAC has the pole position with DonJr as the driver.  It just takes a few introductions and investment dollars in manufacturing capabilities (Elon can help with that) for UMAC to be awarded (directly or indirectly) purchase orders.  If you are a defense contractor hoping to win a bid, would you not include as part of your proposal some business directed to UMAC?

If even 5% of military drone spending makes it through to UMAC, that is $10B in revenue to build the standing army, and $2.5B a year ongoing.  Assuming a 10% net margin, that is $1B in profits on the stockpiling and $250M a year for replacements.  And if there is a US-supplied war somewhere, then it would be even higher.  Ignoring stockpiling revenues and valuing it only on the replacement revenue, at a reasonable 20X PE ratio, this is a $5B market cap company.  That is 33X from current levels.  If they are targeted to achieve that in 10 years, then that implies a current FMV of $1.2B which is 8X from the current $150M market cap or about a $160 stock price.

Think $1.2B is an absurd hype valuation?  Let me introduce you to the psychedelic and weed stocks of a few years ago.  And also the countless biotech stocks that may someday enter into a Phase 1 trial.  And with those stocks, you could not build a case for their valuations.  It was just hype and blind-buying.  UMAC actually has a story and a path towards much bigger things.

investing,Is crypto just a decentralized pyramid scheme?,"I’ve sold my 11k holdings of Bitcoin today, after someone made a point in one of my friend’s discord servers that kinda spooked me.

The opinion was:

> The issue with decentralized cryptocurrencies is that they are fundamentally, worthless. Bitcoin did not become more desirable between today and yesterday. Nothing has caused that movement other than arbitrary changes in supply and demand. So why does it change in price at all? Because people want to make more REAL money, and holding onto Bitcoin has proven to be a viable approach (until it isn’t). Nobody really wants more Bitcoin, they want more dollars, and they believe that holding onto Bitcoin will get them more money. 

> The theory is that the supply of Bitcoin is finite, meaning it can only go up. This almost makes sense. But this doodle I drew on a paper is also finite, that doesn’t mean it has value. For the theory to make sense, this substance needs to be desirable for reasons that aren’t just “someone will pay more for this in a few years” because what happens when you run out of people that want to buy in. You get stuck with a worthless bag.

> While nobody is directly running a pyramid scheme (with mainstream coins), the idea of how profit is made is similar. To make a profit, you need a continuous stream of buy ins despite offering 0 product. Unlike with a company stock, you are buying part of a functional business that generates a profit or has the potential too. Same for real estate or any other investment. Your purchase may be purely to get more dollars, but there are multiple valuation metrics of stuff like this based on real world revenue and profit potential through real operations.

> Some argue that decentralized crypto will replace government regulated money. No, it never will. Centralized government regulated crypto can be a thing, but a decentralized coin causes various challenges such as taxes (meaning the IRS will never want decentralized crypto adoption), government controlled inflation, and stability. Government administered crypto can be a good substitute to physical currency but it will likely be far too many years before that takes off.

investing,Trying to replicate financial advisor's recommended portfolio. Am I close?,"So, long story short, my dad is not very investment savvy but has managed a 7 figure balance among his 5 retirement plan accounts. He is in his 80's and can no longer do many things on his own anymore. I have power of attorney and have been helping him with all of his assets for the past few years.

I'd like to consolidate all of his (5) 403b accounts into one rollover IRA. My dad says he would like to be conservative in his allocations and the financial advisor assigned to one of his accounts suggested a 60/40 weighted portfolio. The documents they gave us have all the allocations by category listed but no tickers. I wouldn't mind avoiding the 1% advisor fee by managing the portfolio myself.

I'm wondering if the list of tickers that I picked per category looks right. Maybe I can simplify it to less tickers? Maybe we can be more aggressive? Keep in mind, that while my dad does need to take RMDs from this, he doesn't really need the income. His social security and rental properties fund all his needs.

investing,Thoughts on buying BRK.Binstead of S&P this month?,"Does anyone have any thoughts on buying BRB.K this month as a one off instead of the usual DCA into S&P 500?

I usually allocate the same amount of money to S&P 500 every month and have done this for years. However given much the stock market is up (27% YTD), especially including the recent trump mania, I think we are due a pull back.

And the way Buffet has been selling stocks recently, so does he. However would spending the same amount this month on Berkshire Hathaway stock instead of S&P, as a one off, hedge against this risk. 

WB has the highest stock pile he’s ever had, whilst still in the market albeit much smaller. I was just thinking it as a way of further diversification - I’ll obviously keep all of my investments in the S&P but as a one off for this month was thinking it could be wise to load up on BH stock, so can receive the benefits of the business of interest from their cash holdings as well as their equity holdings. 

Do you guys think this is a reasonable thought process or just stick to the plan and keep DCAing into the S&P this month?

I get Buffett's picks which are first en masse, second they are consumables, 3rd they are simple to make and simple to consume so the turnover for them to make them again is faster(nothing hard in making gum and softdrinks once perfected and there's nothing hard about chewing and drinking Coke), 4th don't require R and D at some point, I call them en masse consumables. But we have to define consumable, it doesn't have to stop with one person, it can go on to almost forever with the next generations.

Having said that could TSLA be the era for this generation and generations close to it: it's en masse, everybody needs to commute, driving's one's self is convenient, it's consumable in a way coz' you replace things like parts and the vehicle eventually (also energy is bought from Tesla via the superchargers among other things) and there's always new graduates to buy them, 3rd they are not simple to make compared to a gum but technology may have made up for that as it's as simple or close to the simplicity of making a gum (automation + now w/ A.I.), 4th it does require constant R and D but then again technology compensates for that as if there's not much further R and D (especially with A.I. helping with a vehicle's physics and material science).

investing,"New Investment strategy I’m working on, i accept suggestions ","ECFA (Cumulative Fund Growth Strategy)

ECFA is an innovative strategy that combines personal loans from trusted individuals with disciplined investment in ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) to generate growing passive income. It leverages external capital effectively to build wealth while managing risks.

How it Works

	1.	Initial capital: Start with your own investment in low-risk ETFs with a proven track record of dividends.
	2.	Collaborators: Borrow from friends or family, offering them a 10% annual interest rate, paid in monthly installments. The typical term is 5 months.
	3.	Loan investment: Use the borrowed funds to purchase more shares of the same ETFs, increasing both your capital and monthly dividends.
	4.	Loan repayment: At the end of the term, sell enough shares to repay the initial loan while retaining any capital gains.
	5.	Dividend reinvestment: Reinvest all generated dividends to maximize compound growth.

Example in Practice

	•	Initial capital: 6,000 CAD generating 62 CAD/month in dividends.
	•	Year 1: You secure 5 collaborators contributing 2,000 CAD each, totaling 10,000 CAD.
	•	Interest payments: You pay 1,000 CAD in total interest over the year from your own funds.
	•	End of term: You sell shares to repay the 10,000 CAD loan, keeping any capital gains.

By repeating this cycle annually with new collaborators, you accumulate more capital and increase your passive income.

Benefits

	•	For the investor:
	•	Boosts your dividend flow without relying solely on personal funds.
	•	Retains capital gains when ETFs appreciate.
	•	Scalable: Adding more collaborators accelerates portfolio growth.
	•	For collaborators:
	•	Earn a competitive 10% return within a short time frame.
	•	Low risk for them, as they only lend capital and don’t invest directly.

Risks and Mitigation

	1.	Market volatility:
	•	Risk: If ETFs lose value, you might need to cover the shortfall yourself.
	•	Mitigation: Diversify into multiple low-risk ETFs with a strong track record.
	2.	Collaborator trust:
	•	Risk: Losing credibility if payments aren’t fulfilled.
	•	Mitigation: Maintain clear records and honor all payments on time.
	3.	Liquidity risk:
	•	Risk: Reinvesting all dividends may limit cash availability.
	•	Mitigation: Keep an emergency fund to address unexpected expenses.

Conclusion

ECFA is a powerful strategy for building a growing stream of passive income using loaned capital as leverage.

investing,Investing in small Hotels,"Hi All,

First post here and sorry if this is not the right sub for investments other than stock market.

A friend of a friend is building a small hotel/tiny resort (10-15 rooms/small houses) with a pool and activities in and around rural Crete, Greece and is open to investors. 

I’m from one of the APAC countries and am interested in investing in it ($100k-500k) but not what investment options should I consider. 

I’m not interested in Visa (Golden Visa) or right to live in Greece, I just want to own something in a European country, something I can pass onto my children. 

Questions: 

1. What are the typical investment options when investing in small hotels? (Owning shares, % of revenue/profit, owning right to holiday whenever, timeshare etc what am I missing?)

2. Is anyone aware of any regulations or requirements for anyone from APAC investing in European Economic Zone?

3. Do you think it’s a good idea? Yes, why? No, why? 

Thank you so much! 

Edit: the hotel would be run by the that friend of a friend and I know them very well. Very reliable and they have run Airbnb successfully for many years.

Recently they have been doing a huge ad campaign about “locking in interest rates at 7%” targeted at new investors.

Many of these bonds have already have call criteria met (like Tapestry bonds: they were selling them after their merger was blocked which was the call back criteria for the bond).

Many more of these bonds have moderate default risk and high call back risk. Basically they are selling marked up junk bonds as “locked in 7% interest rates” to new investors. With 0.5% fees, plus an additional bond account fee, meaning your real yield is much lower.

investing,Went into investing with a misunderstanding about ETF's and just looking for some input...,"

I have been DCA'ing into VOO and VGT for a little over a year and a half now. I was under some misconceptions because for some reason I used investment calculators, plugged in my starting amount, 10-15% return over 30 years and got a figure of over 1 mil. (This was where my problems started, my portfolio shows +23% and so I assumed that was my returns over long term) I was happy, so started my investing journey. I had a realization a few days ago... Investing calculators use interest, and ETF's do not... They use dividends. And from my understanding, for dividends to make any difference at all, you really need millions already invested.

So my question is... With only 25k currently invested, is there any benefit to continue to DCA into ETF's or should I look into other investment strategies for set and forget (well auto DCA and forget lol)?

I know there's more I want to ask but not sure how to ask it. I thought what I was doing was a good investment strategy but I'm not sure anymore.

investing,Need help understading right issues,"Hey everybody, hope you're doing fine, and happy thanksgiving to those celebrating it!! (Here in Spain we sadly dont)

  
I'm still on the learning stage, and came across the concept of ""right issues"" thought I had understood it properly. However, when I jump to see some up-to date examples on the real market, I got very confused. 

  
So my understanding is that there is a date called ""ex-rights date"" (Correct me if I'm wrong) which is the last date when shareholders can accept the right issue, then after some days-weeks the new shares will jump on the market and the price will adjust to the new volume.

  
So the point here is that as I understand it, there is no profit on buying shares between the ex-rights date and the date when the new shares are introduced, right? Because you are buying shares which will go inevitably go down in price when the price adjust. 

The thing is that I saw the Atos situation, the ex-rights date was 25Nov and the date that the new share will be introduced will be 10 dec +/-, but after 25Nov a lor of people have been buying their shares and I dont understand why because they cant benefit from the right issue and their shares will go down when the new shares are introduced in the market? So, to those looking to invest, wouldnt be more logical to wait till the price adjustment happens and then buy the shares at a lower price? What am I missing here?

investing,the TRUTH about investing no one tells you,"# 1. The system is rigged

The financial industry thrives on overcomplicating things to justify fees.

As Charlie Munger said:*""The whole damn system is corrupt... everyone wants easy money, fast. And that requires a big fee.""*

Think about it: there’s **$2 trillion** locked in mutual funds charging **2% fees** while underperforming cheap index funds like the S&P 500. Who’s really winning here? Hint: it’s not us.



# 2. Temperament beats intelligence

Investing isn’t about being the smartest—it’s about controlling your emotions.

* Warren Buffett: *""The most important quality is temperament, not intellect.""*
* I read a study of a fund that averaged an **18% annual return**, but the **average investor in that fund lost money** because they tried to time the market.

**Lesson:** Fear and greed will destroy your portfolio faster than any bad stock pick.



# 3. The S&P 500 is your cheat code

Here’s your free investing hack: **buy the S&P 500 and chill.**

* Low fees.
* Decades of growth.
* Outperforms **98% of funds** consistently.

Even Charlie Munger admits:*""Wealth managers have almost zero chance of beating an unmanaged index like the S&P.""*

So why do people chase stock-picking glory? Because too many investors confuse excitement with success.



# 4. Picking stocks is really hard

Think it’s easy to find the next Tesla? It’s not. And even if you do, good luck getting in before the hype.

* Buffett: *""If you can’t value the stock, you can’t invest in it. You can gamble on it, but you can’t invest.""*
* Most people buying stocks have never even read a balance sheet.

**Picking winners is possible, but it’s incredibly hard—think Charlie Munger-level hard.**

  
**What this all means**

The truth is, the game is rigged for most people to lose. But that doesn’t mean you can’t win.The winners aren’t the ones chasing hype stocks or flexing their ""10-baggers""—they’re the ones quietly compounding wealth by staying disciplined and focusing on what works: **consistency, patience, and a solid strategy.**

So, how does this match up with your experience? **What lessons have you learned the hard way?**",0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h2886i/the_truth_about_investing_no_one_tells_you/,system rigged financial industry thrives overcomplicating thing justify fee charlie munger saidthe whole damn system corrupt everyone want easy money fast requires big fee think there trillion locked mutual fund charging fee underperforming cheap index fund like sp who really winning hint u temperament beat intelligence investing isnt smartestits controlling emotion warren buffett important quality temperament intellect read study fund averaged annual return average investor fund lost money tried time market lesson fear greed destroy portfolio faster bad stock pick sp cheat code here free investing hack buy sp chill low fee decade growth outperforms fund consistently even charlie munger admitswealth manager almost zero chance beating unmanaged index like sp people chase stockpicking glory many investor confuse excitement success picking stock really hard think easy find next tesla even good luck getting hype buffett cant value stock cant invest gamble cant invest people buying stock never even read balance sheet picking winner possible incredibly hardthink charlie mungerlevel hard mean truth game rigged people lose doesnt mean cant winthe winner arent one chasing hype stock flexing baggerstheyre one quietly compounding wealth staying disciplined focusing work consistency patience solid strategy match experience lesson learned hard way,0.07222222222222223,Positive
investing,Paying off the Mortgage instead of investing for growth ?,"Can someone please explain the focus on paying off the mortgage either as quickly as possible or before retirement?

I’ve bought 4 houses and a vacation condo selling all but the 4th house which I live in and bought 2.5 years ago 

In each case I took out a 30 year mortgage at the best rate available at the time 

My monthly payment ranged from a little over $1,000 to the current $3300

When I sold house #3 after 20 years, I still cleared enough to pay cash for the current house. But, I put down just enough to get a 2.75% mortgage and put the rest into my brokerage account (mostly NVDA & PANL). Now, combined with what was already in the brokerage account and the IRAs, we have a bit over $6M which easily generates over $10k/month - when including social security and small pension is around $20,000/month

I fail to see how we could have acquired this much $ had we accelerated or house payoff

I would like to hear reasoning for paying off the house as my son is asking me for financial advice and I think my system has worked well. Is it a factor of time and luck?

The other thing we are doing that appears to contradict my reading is we are drawing on the IRA money first instead of the brokerage account money. I’m doing this for 2 reasons 1. Keep RMDs (in two more years) from being greater than we need- putting us potentially in higher tax bracket (and Medicare costs) and 2. My son will have to liquidate the inherited IRA within 10 years (more potential taxes) while he can do whatever he wants with stocks at the stepped up basis.  Again, why is this not the generally preferred approach?

Despite this Dell has been doubling down on AI, data centers, and hybrid cloud, which I believe should set them up well for growth in 2025. They also stand to benefit from SMCI’s issues and Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure. With the growing focus on AI and enterprise tech, it feels like Dell could see steady, long-term growth and break out to that $150 range by Q2 2024.

investing,Self-Employed Retirement and Tax Strategies: Where Should I Start?,"Hi everyone,

I've been diving into way too many YouTube videos a lot of (Mark J. Kohler’s channel) about where to start putting retirement funds as a self-employed individual, with an overload of information I don't know if I'm any further with my knowledge. 

Here’s my situation:

* I just turned 34 and have been running my own business for six years.
* For the first five years, I made heavy equipment purchases that provided significant tax deductions, leaving little room to contribute to retirement. Excess cash was reinvested into scaling the business.
* In 2024, I no longer have those large write-offs and don’t foresee major purchases for a while. As a result, my tax bill is projected to be $35-40k this year.
* I roughly have $40K today that I would put toward retirement. 

# Steps I’ve Looked Into So Far:

1. **HSA (Health Savings Account):**
   * I wish I’d started this sooner.
   * I currently have a marketplace PPO plan but wanted to switch to a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) for December to use the “last month rule” and make a 2024 HSA contribution. Unfortunately, I learned this requires a qualifying life event to change plans outside open enrollment, so my HDHP won’t begin until January 2025.
   * I plan to max out the $4,300 contribution for 2025, but this won’t help reduce my 2024 tax burden.
2. **Solo 401(k):**
   * This seems like a logical next step to reduce taxes and begin building retirement savings.

# Additional Notes:

* I haven’t set up an S-corp yet. The main reason is that I’m planning to build a garage-house in 2026 and want to avoid complicating my tax returns for loan qualification. Once the loan is secured, I’ll likely switch to an S-corp.

# My Questions for You:

1. What would you prioritize to maximize tax savings and begin retirement funding for 2024?
2. Are there other strategies or accounts (besides an HSA and Solo 401(k)) that I should be considering?

investing,"UBS (managed) to Fidelity (self- directed) brokerage account, need advice","I was a saver for a long time and started a fully managed UBS brokerage account 2 years ago, the fees were 1%.  I recently decided to switch my account to Fidelity, to a self manage brokerage account. Everything transferred over smoothly, didn't have t sell anything as there were to proprietary UBS funds. 

UBS made me a really conservative portfolio, that's' my fault because I told them I didn't want to take losses.



I have 2 options with fidelity:



 Option 1: my plan was to go self managed and have a 4 fund portfolio: 60% US total market, 20% international total market, 10% growth and 10% Bonds. The problem is that what was transferred from UBS is a mess of ETFs and asset allocation is really bad with 42% bonds! So obviously I have to rebalance for a more aggressive portfolio. 



Option 2: I have a call next Dec the 2nd with a fidelity advisor about the benefits of going with a fully managed account (they're the ones who called me and I agreed to listen to them), the highlights are fees of 0.3- 0.7%, and tax loss harvesting. He said that with what with they can save me with tax loss harvesting, etc, they can beat the market by 1%, but i don't if I believe that.



Questions:

If I go with option 1, based on my positions (attached), would I have to sell a lot and buy the funds I want and create a big tax event? Or can  trade ETFs so I don't take big tax hit? My first step is to convert about 32% of my bonds to stocks. Would rebalancing be a panfull prcess? is my 4 fund portfolio plan okay?: 60% US total market, 20% international total market, 10% growth and 10% Bonds. Any recommendations? I think I can ride a stock market downturn, hopefully (see numbers below).

Or should I go with option 2 (fully managed account) and tell them to go aggressive a let them do their thing? Would  this be more beneficial in my case? 



Some context that can help with answering questions:

\- $550k portfolio, I max out 401K and Roth IRA every year, will contribute to the rest to brokerage account every paycheck. 

\-  $30k emergency fund, Only debt is $800 a month mortgage (60k balance). I'm not a big spender.

investing,Bitcoin Created a Paradox,"Bitcoin was engineered to solve a specific problem: creating a non-inflationary currency free from centralized control. But there's a fascinating paradox at its core that I haven't seen discussed enough.

**The Paradox**

Traditional stores of value (like gold) became valuable because they were naturally stable. Bitcoin is trying to do this backwards - it was engineered to be a store of value before achieving stability. Here's the problem: a currency needs stability to be useful, but Bitcoin won't stabilize until it's widely used.

This creates a chicken-and-egg problem:
- People won't use it as a currency until it's stable
- It won't stabilize until there's widespread usage
- But widespread usage requires stability...

**The Investment Case**

When you buy Bitcoin, you're betting on it eventually solving this stability paradox. If it succeeds in becoming the global store of value, the upside is massive. Consider what capturing even a fraction of these markets would mean:
- Global gold market ($12.5T)
- Government forex reserves ($12T)
- Institutional treasury reserves
- Corporate balance sheets
- Sovereign wealth funds

With only 21M coins available, basic math suggests each coin would need to be worth several hundred thousand or even millions of dollars to absorb these markets..",0,80,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h1n2k7/bitcoin_created_a_paradox/,bitcoin engineered solve specific problem creating noninflationary currency free centralized control there fascinating paradox core havent seen discussed enough paradox traditional store value like gold became valuable naturally stable bitcoin trying backwards engineered store value achieving stability here problem currency need stability useful bitcoin wont stabilize widely used creates chickenandegg problem people wont use currency stable wont stabilize there widespread usage widespread usage requires stability investment case buy bitcoin youre betting eventually solving stability paradox succeeds becoming global store value upside massive consider capturing even fraction market would mean global gold market government forex reserve institutional treasury reserve corporate balance sheet sovereign wealth fund coin available basic math suggests coin would need worth several hundred thousand even million dollar absorb market,0.15460526315789475,Positive

investing,Is MicroStrategy’s Strategy Innovative Financial Engineering or Something Riskier?,"I’ve been digging into **MicroStrategy** (Ticker: MSTR) and its bold strategy of going all-in on Bitcoin—positioning themselves as a “Bitcoin proxy.” They’ve adopted a pure-play approach, using billions in low-interest convertible bonds (sometimes at 0%) to fund [massive Bitcoin acquisitions](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microstrategy-makes-record-breaking-bitcoin-084042808.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAITnZfmYGc_hWsrAN9TW9btBfpMrT9l2sRgYV8tpd7i45PIcC4TW-MJ3ueqnXfglWEfcmQcNnQ15Qmb7BuliSKOkcsKRCHddLb-Suzh5O4HYTg-smdaf-cAKHFWuvsJheahdS1ymmBC5ZPgNZSba489qkPOS17jX9j3lV_8aJzuk).

From what I understand, MicroStrategy sells stock volatility to convertible bondholders, who profit from the “Gamma game.” Meanwhile, retail shareholders often see it as a straightforward Bitcoin play, which seems to leave them exposed to significant downside risks, like dilution and price drops. Bondholders, on the other hand, are protected with senior claims and hedged positions.

I’m curious to hear your thoughts:

1. Could this model collapse if Bitcoin’s price or market volatility drops significantly, given its reliance on continuous capital inflows?
2. Do you see this as a clever piece of financial engineering—or is it closer to something riskier, perhaps a pyramid scheme....?

For context, I’ve looked into a few sources that break this down in more detail:

* **Michael Saylor on Valuetainment (PBD Podcast)**: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n53qmZ84zC0&ab_channel=Valuetainment)

investing,Confused about when to take profits,"So this does get a bit into the conversation of ""timing the markets"" which there is never a right way to do that.  

I currently have a chunk of my Roth IRA in FBTC (Fidelity Bitcoin Fund). I took advantage years ago in getting into GBTC (prior to the SEC ETF approvals). After the approvals, I ended up selling (at a tiny loss) the GBTC and moved those funds into FBTC, probably $14k worth, when it was around $35.  I've since weekly contributed to it and my avg basis is around $44.  FBTC is currently trading around $83 due to BTC hovering around $95k.  I am long on BTC, however I am currently up around 88%.  I have a smaller amount in MSTR with an avg basis of $100, and that is up over 250%.  

I've read before ""take out your initial investment to freeze profits"".  So in my FBTC scenario, does that mean when I feel like pulling the trigger I'd pull out $14k...under the assumption I think  there will be a pullback at some point..in which case I'd buy in at the lower amount (let's say $70-75 ish). 

So this sounds like it would raise my cost basis from $44 to probably near 70, yes? I'm just trying to understand the appropriate way one should 'take profit' when it comes to investing.

investing,Questions regarding swing trading - is my approach interpreted correctly?,"Hi all, first post here, hope the question is in the right subreddit.

I followed a strict buy and hold strategy up until now, but wanted to spice things up a little by introducing swing trades with a small % of my portfolio. As I read through various strategies and derivatives, something came up my mind and I wanted to see if my logic is flawed here.

The idea of swing trade was made with limit buys and limit sells. But as time went on, I read about options, specifically writing options. So now, instead of using limit sells and limit buys, isn't it obviously better to write cash secured puts and covered calls options with the anyway desired strike price? This way, you get the same strike price as a limit order, but as long as the strike is not met, you earn premium.

Is there any flaw to this logic? Am I overlooking something?

investing,Most big airline stocks are up by 33-166% since August. Any ideas why?,"I recently noticed that United Airlines went through the roof in the last few months, so I looked at a bunch of other airlines and found that most of them are doing really well since the first week of August. Most of them were going downhill until then, but then they collectively went up really fast, even though at the same time we saw the largest plunge in the stock market in two years. Why is that?  
  
Some examples from August until today:  
US:  
United: 34,61 to 92,40€ (+166%)  
Delta: 32,45 to 62,44€ (+92%)  
American: 8,37 to 14,22€ (+69%)  
Southwest: 21,91 to 31,19€ (+42%)

International:  
IAG (British Airways and Iberia) 1,65 to 3,06€ (+85%)  
Quantas 3,42 to 5,45 (+59%)  
RyanAir 13,60 to 18,59€ (+36%)  
EasyJet  4,80 to 6,40 (+33%)
  
Of course I have googled this, but couldn't find a good answer. A Forbes article believes that it's because of lower fuel prices, but is that enough for those massive gains? And why are there some major airlines that aren't doing well at all, like Lufthansa, KLM (Air France) and of course Spirit? Fuel Prices should help all of them equally.

investing,Question AEG Model vs Residual Earning Model,"Dear Community,

I'm actually working on Penman's Financial Statement Analysis and Security Valuation (self-study) on the Residual Income Model and the AEG Model.

I think I understood the Residual Earning Model well enough to use for my own Valuation pruposes, but the AEG Model is giving me some sort of confusion, especially when i compare the calculated values of both models in comparison.

In one drill exercise i have to calculate the AEG and Residual Earnings for IBM using the following data:

Required Rate of Return: 10%

Book Value of 2010: 18.77 $/share

2011:

Earnings per Share: 13.22$  
Dividend per Share: 3$

2012:

Earnings per Share: 14.61$  
Dividend per Share: 3.3$

After that the growth will be 11% for both the EPS and DPS in the next 3 years..

When i calculate everything I receive the following data:

Residual Earnings: 2011: 11.34 $/share

Residual Earnings: 2012: 11.71 $/share

Residual Earnings: 2013: 12.19 $/share

Residual Earnings: 2014: 12.71 $/share

Residual Earnings: 2011: 13.3 $/share

AEG 2012: 0.368

AEG 2013: 0.479

AEG 2014: 0.524

AEG 2015: 0.587

So i can actually prove, that the change in residual earnings equal the difference in AEG.

But when i calculate the intrinsic value things get confusing for me.

In both Valuation-Models i would discount the calculated numbers accordingly by (1+0.1)\[t\] and add the value with either Book Value of 2010 for Residual Earnings or with EPS of 2011 for the AEG Model.

The last thing i have to do is divide the result of the equation in the AEG model by the capitalization rate of r to get my value per share.

I double checked my calculations and got a valuation of 58.37 with Residual Earnings and of 147.45 with the AEG Model. I know, that actually I havent used a continuing Value for both models, but this shouldnt explain the huge difference based on these numbers. Did I do a mistake in my calculations or in the formula or what do I miss?

I hope someone may be able to help me.",3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h0ne4x/question_aeg_model_vs_residual_earning_model/,dear community im actually working penman financial statement analysis security valuation selfstudy residual income model aeg model think understood residual earning model well enough use valuation pruposes aeg model giving sort confusion especially compare calculated value model comparison one drill exercise calculate aeg residual earnings ibm using following data required rate return book value share earnings per share dividend per share earnings per share dividend per share growth eps dp next year calculate everything receive following data residual earnings share residual earnings share residual earnings share residual earnings share residual earnings share aeg aeg aeg aeg actually prove change residual earnings equal difference aeg calculate intrinsic value thing get confusing valuationmodels would discount calculated number accordingly add value either book value residual earnings eps aeg model last thing divide result equation aeg model capitalization rate r get value per share double checked calculation got valuation residual earnings aeg model know actually havent used continuing value model shouldnt explain huge difference based number mistake calculation formula miss hope someone may able help,0.04000000000000001,Positive
investing,Daytrading is pretty psychotic.(Unpopular Opinion),"I'm into investing and while scrolling through multiple forums, I find people talking about daytrading like it's a sport.

investing,Thoughts on uranium / nuclear stocks in next 5 years?,"This year, many uranium miners / nuclear stocks' prices have increased multiple times, I've selected some companies which look good to invest:

1. CCJ (Cameco) 

2. CEG (Constellation Engery) 

3. Uranium Energy Corp (UEC)

These companies provide either uranium material or nuclear component to build nuclear power plants which seem to be demanded significantly in this period.

  
However, I don't know if this trend will continue in next 5 years? I think the oil prices will drop significantly, then people will want to invest to oil / gas power plants which are cheaper to generate electricity. AI / data centers are the only objects which require a lot of power, green energy is the trend for sure, but it is highly dependent from the lead of leaders in the most developed countries.

-I thiiiink I remember that these funds are scheduled on maturity (6-12 month terms?). Correct me if I’m wrong. How would I get (hopefully grown) money out of the fund, and what are the tax implications? 

-is this one of those things that only works with large holdings? Like the transaction/mgmt/whatever other fees and tax burden of gains on a $1k investment isn’t worth the trouble but gains would outweigh tax from a $10k investment? (For example, probably a poorly-explained one at that, but I hope I’m being clear enough…)

I really have very little idea of what I’m talking about, so please let me know if im completely off base here. I just want to know what he meant by the title of this post, and, if it’s an option available to unremarkables with a little exploratory cash, low/moderate risk tolerance, and low ambition for active management, do big or small positions  make more sense to buy in with, and what are the tax implications?

investing,What is your investment strategy for your HSA in particular?,"HSA's are a very specific type of investment vehicle that its intended use case is almost entirely for medical expenses. As such, that makes it a very different vehicle than an IRA, 401k, traditional brokerage acct, etc., because unlike those options (that technically can be used for much more than just medical moreso than an HSA tends to) they are primarily for retirement **AND NOT** just for medical expenses.

That is a significant note to take note of  because say you're FIRE, want to use a portion for a house, want to roll money in from a former employer etc. You are **locked into** primarily **just** medical expenses which is the most unpredictable thing out there. Especially if younger. The real reason I'm asking is that unlike retirement, HSA's may have more immediate use cases. Especially with a family. As such, putting your funds into longer term investments sounds like a huge no go. However, plenty of people have said they still put the money in the longer term investments.

Now, you have the option of course just paying out of pocket in order to not touch the HSA, but if you do so you basically lock in not being able to touch your money without penalty until you're 65+(?) I believe. So while sure great ""triple tax advantage,"" but good luck touching that for that to matter until 65+. My initial thoughts have always been to keep it in short term investments like SGOV, USFR, etc. so I have it on hand for medical expenses and can even pay with a cc and reimburse myself from the HSA. 

I have, however, in the back of my head, thought ""I could instead use this for extra tax advantaged ""retirement savings,"" but since I'm an early retirement guy it flusters me to have to wait until 65+ to use money. I try to keep my options more fluid for access. What is your thinking on this for yourself? Do you keep it in short term investments? Do you go long term? A mix?

investing,Cost of Capital (Real-World) - Equity vs Debt,"So this isn't about CAPM - I think enough has been written describing its limitations -but, rather, how a  company's stock price should guide corporate financing decisions in the real world. I think my question is best elucidated through an example.

Take, for example, the world's simplest (and public) company (and it exists in a tax-free universe!). It has 10M shares outstanding. The company only business is that it entered into a 5-year contract where, upon inception, it needs to invest $50M.  It will then receive a stream of cash flows (totaling $200M) and then pay a dividend to shareholders and liquidate. 

Now, a lender will offer to finance $60M ($50M + $10M for cushion) at a 10% fixed rate (100% due at maturity).

However, as the CEO you can obviously also sell stock. Now if the market get's overly exuberant (i.e. Gamestop in 2021) and assigns you a market cap of $1B, or $100 per share, then it is obvious that it is better (for existing shareholders) for you to issue 600k shares (or 6% of your current share count) to raise the $60M dollar.  On the other hand, if the market cap is severely depressed, say $25M (or $2.50 per share), then it doesn't make sense to issue 24M shares when you can get debt financing at 10%.

My question is, how do you analytically figure out what the ""break-even"" stock price is given some known cost of debt? (And, yes, we are also ignoring that debt should be cheaper because it has claims above equity). In a simple model I linked below, I tried to first do the equity financing scenario and then plugged in the cost of equity (which I calculated as the CAGR to the ending stock price) as the cost of debt but it resulted in different ending stock prices. What is the right way to solve for this ""break-even"" point.  See my simple model in the picture below.

The second highest in the SPAC space is Lotus Technology,（NASDAQ：LOT） which raised $1.35 billion. Moreover, Lotus has demonstrated rapid growth. In the first three quarters of 2024, Lotus reported total revenue of $653 million, a year-on-year increase of 105%; service revenue reached $29 million, up 129%; deliveries exceeded 7,600 units, a 136% year-on-year growth.

Unfortunately, Lotus Technology’s daily trading volume is relatively low, making it difficult for large funds to invest. DJT, on the other hand, is entirely different, with daily trading volume reaching hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars, making it one of the hottest companies in the market. That said, its valuation is relatively high, and the early surge was too steep. So, could it be that the next big rally might not come until just before the inauguration?",0,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h0dvsl/the_recent_surge_in_djtnasdaqdjt_seems_to_have/,previously djt peaked quickly dropped around election trading sideways since company average value greatest asset trump believe next wave growth may come inaugurationassuming unexpected event occur think speaking djt truly remarkable since beginning raised staggering billion making spac company highest fundraising amount second highest spac space lotus technologynasdaqlot raised billion moreover lotus demonstrated rapid growth first three quarter lotus reported total revenue million yearonyear increase service revenue reached million delivery exceeded unit yearonyear growth unfortunately lotus technology daily trading volume relatively low making difficult large fund invest djt hand entirely different daily trading volume reaching hundred million even billion dollar making one hottest company market said valuation relatively high early surge steep could next big rally might come inauguration,0.07575963718820862,Positive

investing,Keep condo as investment income or sell and refi mortgage?,"Hi all hoping for some help here. I’ll break down the current situation.

I also have a fully paid condo that is worth about $260k and nets $900 in rent revenue/month before taxes.

I can keep renting out the condo or sell it, get ~$230, and refinance my home for a 15 year mortgage. Timing would be next year when rates would hopefully drop.

investing,Buy a house or keep the money in stocks? (and keep spending crazy amount on rent),"

Anyone up for some brainstorming? I need advice.

I live in LA because my job wants me to be in the office twice per week. If they didn’t, I’d be living 80% of the year in Europe and the rest somewhere tropical. 

I just hit 500k in investments. I’m 36. 
They need to be diversified, so I will have to make some changes either way. 

I pay 3400 per month in rent. 
My take home salary is 6500 per month. 

Found a nice house in the mountains for 400k. It’s 1,5 hours from LA if I time it right. I can see myself wanting to keep it as a vacation home/rental income but for the foreseeable future I would live there and commute. The total monthly expense would be 2500 max, if I put 20% down. 

I’ve been successful before with designing my home and selling it with a very good profit. So I believe I have what it takes to make it a popular short term rental and also make a good profit when I want to sell. 

I think selling the place if I had to would be hard though, in the next few years which scares me. I could probably cover some of the cost by renting out, but that is also not guaranteed. 

I also would miss out on growth of the money I would put in the down payment. And it’s impossible to know if the house will be a good investment or not. But I would probably be ok keeping it, if nothing too crazy happens. So I would not sell at a loss.

investing,Why are SP500 and DJIA *open price* quotes completely out of whack (compared to actual opens & futures),"Basically, what the question says.

I compared the open/close % for future but many times that return is way different than the index return. Also, for DJIA, I calc'd the actual index (as it is just a simple average, divided by a divisor) - same issue.

Been scratching my head to understand this - if anyone knows, please enlighten me. Recent dates such as Oct 15 and Nov 6 are especially off for DJIA. Is there a reason for this?

Edit 1: obv, I'm looking at synchronous times of 9:30 am ET and 4 pm ET close.

Edit 2:

let's look at Oct 15 2024 for DJIA index. Using DJIA because it's easier to replicate using 30 stocks with simple avg.  
The open was ""43,240.17"" and close was 42,740.42 (per Google finance and also Yahoo finance). so the return is -1.16%

1. Futures check: If you look at the YM futures contract, the contract at 9:30 am was 43203 and close at 4pm ET was 43006. so the return is -.45%.
2. 30 stock components check: I also averaged the component stocks for DJIA. the sum of the open of all stocks and the sum of all the close of stocks ties out well. (ignoring the divisor, which doesn't matter for 1 day return) open: 6358.09 close: 6328.52 with -.45%.

I can provide the open and close for the components for that day if needed.

investing,Is portfolio rebalancing worth it if you have to incur capital gains tax to do so?  ,"Over the past four years, I've accumulated a pretty outsized position in my employer's stock due to being granted RSUs, participating in my company's employee stock purchase program, and then the stock price appreciating much faster than I had expected. I didn't intend for it to get this out of hand, but the current  breakdown is:   
   
Majority of portfolio:  
68% Employer stock  ($167,000 unrealized gain, $304,000 total value)

Remainder of portfolio:  
32% VOO, VOOG, and various other small positions in individual companies. 

My question is: is it really worth incurring the 15% capital gains tax on a $167,000 gain just to rebalance the portfolio? I want to get the employer stock position down to the recommended 5-10% and reinvest into an S&P500 or Total US Market index fund, but I don't see a way to do that without paying through the nose in taxes.

I understand the importance of diversification, but does it actually make sense to pay close to $30,000 in taxes to accomplish this? For instance, let's say the company stock takes a 10% hit. Well, that would also be in the neighborhood of a $30,000 loss, but it's only a loss on paper. In other words, I wouldn't have to pay anything out of pocket to the IRS. On the other hand, actively rebalancing the portfolio would mean I'd owe taxes next year and would have to find a way to come up with that money out of pocket.

investing,Why not sell a stock with a consensus of hold?,"My problem is that I don't seem to be able to sell a stock. I should have sold BNTX when I was up over 300%. I rode it up, and I rode it back down. I'm up like 25%, but I believe in them so I keep holding.

However, I have a stock that is down 50% since I bought it. I won't mention the company because I'm not talking about this specific company. I am talking about holding a company that all the analyst say to hold. I wouldn't buy this company now if I didn't own it. What does hold even mean? I could sell, harvest the loss, and buy something with a more favorable outlook? What does ""hold"" even mean?

Edit: As a clarification, this is (for me) a relatively small account that I set up for fun. If I lose some money, it won't hurt me. Picking stocks as a hobby, I guess. Even still, 60% of the funds are in ETF's with 1/3 of the account in VOO, and the remainder of the ETF's in descending order being VOT, JEPQ, VB, and SCHD.

investing,"Convert my Vanguard Mutual Funds (VIGAX, VTIAX, VTSAX) to ETF?","I have some decent positions in VIGAX --> $129k | VTIAX --> $34k | VTSAX --> $358k

I started with mutual funds for no good reason really other then the monthly auto-purchasing was easier and the expense ratio was equal or better than the equivalent ETF at the time. I know ETFs are more tax efficient and at times I regret my decision to not go ETF but I thought switching would create a taxable event. I just learned that it possibly does NOT. Looking at the transaction history for this year, I don't see any capital gains sales and just ""dividends"" which I assume would happen inside of the ETF as well.

investing,How Do You Feel About Investing In Google Now?,"Last year I started a similar thread following the disastrous Helpful Content Update where Google started de-indexing many of the best small to medium sized informational websites. Depending on what area of the internet you are searching in you might not notice quickly, but once you go to a space of search where it happened (like Local) you notice it instantly.

Well here we are over a year later and things have only gotten worse. I don't know anyone who is satisfied with the search results, and many like myself have avoided using Google as much as possible.

I know they are a massive company with tons going on, but at the end of the day when you ask someone on the street what Google is they will tell you search. And the main part of their brand is about as bad as it can be currently.

Do you still feel confident investing in a company that cares this little about their main customer facing product? I mean, you could pretty easily argue they are intentionally trying to be bad. Yet the investment dollars keep piling in.

investing,Playing the long game with Bitcoin,"Hi all,

I’m new to the crypto and investing world, and I would like to gain money from it.

The strategy I have in mind is to put small amounts of money in Bitcoin weekly or monthly (100-200$) and let it compound over time (10-20 years). Basically I’m looking at Bitcoin as a way to store money to not lose its value, and hopefully grow in the future.

Also I play on doing this on Binance due to the low fees and P2P options to buy crypto.

The question is: Is this a good strategy? would I risk my money by putting it in one platform or should I even buy a hardware wallet. If not, what are other ways to use Bitcoin as a mean to keep money value and let it compound over time, I heard about staking but I have no idea..

investing,Isn't rebalancing selling your winners and keeping your losers?,"I've been thinking about the philosophy of rebalancing. The purpose of rebalancing your portfolio (just buy all stocks bro, excluded) is to maintain a risk profile that's consistent with your goals. 

So say if NVDA went up by 300% and INTC got halved and now NVDA is 80% of your portfolio. The philosophy of rebalancing would demand you to sell a large portion of NVDA and invest in INTC. 

That strategy if we look at the chart, doesn't work so well for your wallet. 

So here's me wondering if rebalancing on the surface is ""buy low sell high"" when in reality it's just ""sell your winners and buy more losers"".

investing,529 vs taxable brokerage for post secondary in Canada,"Not sure whether to start a 529 or a taxable brokerage for my daughters education.  I have a pretty unusual situation which makes it less straight forward

We are Canadian now living in the US
My son was born in canada and he has an RESP (Canadian 529) that I started when he was born and been adding to it every month.
My daughter is born in the US, but because of naturalization she is dual as well.  I haven't started an education fund yet because of some issues that had come up the last few yeass.  I will be coming into a fair bit of money in 4 to 6 months and can start an account with a large enough set to catch up to her brother and get us back on track as if I started when she was born 

Here's the tricky part. 
If my kids want to do post secondary, they're going to do it in Canada. Not worth going to school in America unless its on some kind of full scholarship.
For reference, my son has interest in Engineering like me, and a 4 year degree at my school (among top 5 in canada) costs less than 1 year at the same program at the big schools in my state. 45K CAD for 4 years is better than 124K USDfor the same program where we live

529s can be used for school in canada but my understanding is I wouldn't get the tax free benefits of a 529 because it's being spent in canada.  So because of that, is there an advantage to opening it anyways vs a taxable brokerage account.  The brokerage account would give more flexibility as how it's used and could potentially grow my more than a 529. 529s are good for school costs but some things related to being away from school aren't included (rent, food, transport, etc) so the brokerage could be working towards covering their basic living needs too

investing,Abnormal Earnings Growth Model and Capitalization Rate Question,"Dear Value-Investors ,

I'm actually working on Penmans 'Financial Statement Analysis and Valuation' and I have a question about the AEG-Model.

When i do my valuation based on the AEG - Model,  anchoring on forward P/E the formula is pretty similar to the residual income or DCF Model. 
In his examples he is dividing his calculatef  intrinsic value by the capitalization rate ( the same as the required rate of return?) to get the capitalized NPV. I have a hard time understanding this,  because the difference between an intrinsic value of say 2.48 is completely different than the value after capitalize it with like 10÷ (24.8) logically. 

From my feeling the 2.48 is the value that I use to challenge the market price, but why capitalize it then? Is it because the AEG model either ommiting Continuing Value or assumes a constant growth-rate?

I hope somebody may be able to help.

investing,Money Market Risk in a stock market crash.  Maybe long term treasuries are better.,"Money Markets are very low risk but they have been tested in the past and have been “rescued” by the federal government in 2008 when they “broke the buck”.

It’s been some time since then and I had forgotten about a little bit of a bank run situation that some people experienced.

I have been enjoying the sweet return on Money Market funds that I have had in these funds the past year or so.  

Recently, with markets at extremely elevated valuations, I find myself considering the possibility of another financial crisis or severe market correction that may present itself soon.  No one knows but it’s time for me personally to prepare for the possibility of a recessionary crash.  But let’s not get side tracked on that notion.

I’m reflecting on the GFC and I am wondering if money markets are really where I want to put some money.  Maybe I should consider long term treasury etf.  This would be money set aside specifically to buy stocks at discount in a market crash.

If there was a deflationary crash, long term bond prices should increase as people flock to safety.   I’m just not sure money markets are as safe as treasury etf.

investing,Living off of my US savings in India.,"Suppose I invest 1M USD in

    VOO 70%,
    QQQ 10%,
    VCLT(Long term corp bonds) 10%,
    TLT(Long term treasury bonds) 10%

And I live off 20K USD per year in India. Which gets me around 1.25 Lakhs per month roughly after taxes.

I am 33 years old. Single. My parents are leaving me an apartment in India. I also don't drink Alcohol or smoke. So I can lead a really luxurious life in India on that money. I also get to live with my parents in their old age. Which makes me feel good because I am not abandoning them in their old age as their only kid. Till they die we will be sharing expenses. Even if we don't I can comfortably cover my own expenses and their expenses too. I cannot cover their health emergencies. But they have around around 400K USD(3 crores of savings) to cover their health emergencies.

I am healthy. But even then, you can get an open heart surgery done in India for like 6000$ or 7000$. I can get like 3 to 4 of those before I die anyways. So if I even set aside 20K USD for health emergencies(I will also be getting a health insurance in India anyways) I will be still left with 980K USD.

I ran a Monte Carlo Simulation using this tool(https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/monte-carlo-simulation#analysisResults)

1. Inflation I set it to 6.75% mean and 2.8% Variance(That's roughly India's inflation parameters for the last 10 years. It's not exactly a normal distribution. But it's close enough to be called a normal distribution.)
2. USD generally seems to be always gaining over INR. By around 0.25% mean and 1.5% variance in the last 10 years. But I left that out intentionally.
3. I choose historical returns from 2014 to 2023.
4. Capital gains tax 20%, dividend tax 30%. Which is roughly what I have to pay to US and India together after Dual taxation avoidance treaty(DTAA).
5. No income tax because I would have no income in either India or US.

And it looks like in 95% of the cases, I will not run out of money in the next 75 years. Even if I do run out of money, I also have around 250K in 401K. That I am not going to touch, till I am 60. And it is 100% invested in VOO(or similar mutual funds). So in the 5% of the case that I do run out of money and I happen to live more than 90 years, I can use my 401K money.

I'm exploring long-term investing in stocks and looking for internationally accessible platforms that allow me to hold positions for several years without charging inactivity fees.

investing,Crypto and Blockchain! Does it earn a place in your portfolio?,"Blockchain technology has been a significant focus of media and public discourse. Some view it as a revolutionary advancement with transformative potential, while others associate it with speculation and opportunism. Regardless of these perspectives, blockchain technology is more than just a speculative tool for investors; it has a variety of applications that could reshape industries. To fully appreciate this technology, it’s crucial to understand how it works and the scope of its capabilities.

A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger that records transactions in a decentralized manner. Unlike traditional ledgers controlled by a single authority, a blockchain is distributed across a network of participants. This decentralization ensures transparency, as all users can view the ledger, and consensus mechanisms allow the network to agree on its true state without requiring a central authority.

One widely used method for concensus is called Proof of Work (PoW), where miners solve complex computational problems to validate transactions. This process ensures the security of the blockchain by requiring the agreement of more than 50% of miners to determine the legitimate version of the ledger. Miners are incentivized through rewards in cryptocurrency and transaction fees.

Proof of Stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism designed to address the high energy consumption of Proof of Work (PoW). Instead of miners solving computational problems, PoS relies on validators who “stake” their cryptocurrency as collateral to secure the network and validate transactions. Similarly, stakers get rewarded in fees and in the newly issued crypto asset. 

Another critical feature of blockchains, particularly Ethereum, is smart contracts. These self executing contracts encode agreements directly into code, ensuring automatic execution when predefined conditions are met. Smart contracts enable applications like decentralized finance (DeFi) and provide benefits such as increased transparency, reduced reliance on intermediaries, and automation. Behind each transaction, a gas token is a prerequisite to compensate validators. Think of this as the lubricant allowing the blockchain to operate smoothly, otherwise people could spam transactions and contest the network. 

Potential Applications of Blockchain Technology

1.Financial Services:

Blockchain enables low-cost, fast, and secure cross-border payments, requiring only a recipient’s public address.
Smart contracts facilitate decentralized financial applications, allowing users to lend, borrow, and earn interest without banks.
DeFi can expand financial access for the unbanked and underbanked, offering opportunities that traditional banking systems may not.

2.Supply Chain Management:

Blockchain can track real-world objects using tokens, improving supply chain transparency. Tokens can record timestamps, receipts, and provenance, addressing traceability issues in global logistics.

3.Digital Assets and NFTs:
Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique, indivisible tokens with diverse applications beyond digital art, such as supply chain tracking, media rights, and digital receipts.
4.Other Uses:
Blockchain technology supports secure voting systems, intellectual property management, and efficient healthcare recordkeeping.

Challenges and Misconceptions

1.Association with Scams:
While blockchain’s decentralized nature empowers innovation, it also enables malicious actors to create fraudulent tokens and applications. Users must exercise due diligence to ensure the legitimacy of the platforms they interact with.
	
2.Environmental Concerns:
PoW-based blockchains like Bitcoin are often criticized for their high energy consumption. However, miners frequently utilize renewable energy sources due to cost advantages. Studies suggest that over half of PoW mining operations incorporate green energy.

3.Misunderstanding NFTs:
NFTs are often mischaracterized as solely representing digital artwork. In reality, they serve broader purposes, including representing real-world assets, enabling supply chain tracking, and verifying ownership of digital and physical goods.

Pros and Limitations of Blockchain

Pros:
Transparency: Publicly accessible ledgers ensure trust and reduce corruption.
Decentralization: Eliminates reliance on central authorities, increasing security and resilience.
Ownership: Blockchains empower individuals to own and take control of their own data rather than hand it over to intermediaries.

Limitations:
Scalability: Many blockchains face limitations in processing a high volume of transactions quickly.

Energy Consumption: PoW mechanisms consume significant energy, raising sustainability concerns.

Regulatory Uncertainty: Governments worldwide continue to debate how to regulate blockchain and its applications.

Speculation: While the various applications of blockchain seem promising, blockchains aren’t being used in many practical ways currently, and it is debatable on whether or not blockchain technology is capable of complementing or replacing existing technologies in any meaningful way.

My thoughts:

In the spirit of “owning the market”, I hold a small Crypto allocation, mainly in Ethereum. Proof of stake crypto currencies actually return fees to “stakers”. This is not too dissimilar to equities, where equity holders have a claim to the cash flows of a business. Ethereum is also a prerequisite to interact with any of the protocols or applications or tokens built on its network, thus there is demand for Ether beyond pure speculation. 

Other crypto assets, like Bitcoin, do not produce or really do anything, making it a subpar asset to hold til perpetuity. Its value is entirely extrinsic. 

Still, a healthy dose of skepticism is required. It’s not entirely clear to me, and many others, that this technology will meaningfully be implemented.

investing,Emotionally invested in a stock and not selling despite all advice - what would you do?,"Here’s the story: I started investing when I was much younger, self-employed, and didn’t have much money. The idea of investing seemed complicated and out of my reach but I heard about this company called ShareBuilder where you could buy fractional shares just purchasing stocks at $25 at a time. That’s how I made my first investment in an individual stock, with regular small to medium purchases for several years. 

Although I started investing in other stocks that first one kept growing until it was out sizing my portfolio. Everything I was reading, and everyone I spoke with - to this day - warns against having an out sized investment in one individual company. After being worn down by family and every book or article I read, about ten years ago I sold a chunk. After which the original stock continued to climb until as of today it’s grown 16,713%. My strategy over the years was to buy around it and try to build more diversity which I’ve been doing pretty good at. But it keeps doing well. 

I was going through my allocations and loaded everything in Empower’s app and once again I saw an alert that I had a lot in one security and should diversify. I had a really emotional NO reaction to seeing that. If I compare the funds I reinvested when I sold off a bunch, the gains are nowhere comparable. 

Realizing my reaction was a little over the top, I thought I’d see if strangers in the internet could give me some clarity 🤣

So my question is: has anyone been in a situation like this? What did you do? Did you listen to all the advice or continue to go with your gut? My gut says through its ups and downs, I think this is still a strong investment. If I was your friend or family member what would you say?

I’m not mentioning the company because there are a lot of opinions buy/sell about the company itself but through its ups and downs it’s been a good one for the long haul. And that was my intention, to buy for the long game. It’s been almost a 20 year long game now! Not trying to hide anything and happy to share the company name if someone’s interested.

investing,Too Much Invested In The Market?,"Lately I’ve been wondering if I should pull some money off market and back into a high-yield savings account.  Things have been great for the past two years, and rumblings from the incoming administration have me concerned. Buffet’s sell off is another red flag.

I have 65% of my wealth invested in Vanguard, my 2 work retirement accounts and a small amount bitcoin.  The Vanguard and retirement account money is mostly in index funds like VTSAX and VTIAX, with a small percentage in VGT and VOO.  Over the past two years, the Vanguard and retirement accounts are up 20-23%, and the bitcoin is up 68%.

I pulled some off market in 2016 when Trump was saying all sorts of crazy stuff and regretted it later on, when the economy started doing really well.  I’m not one to try timing the market typically, and part of me just says never sell, but I’m suspicious of the coming months.  I’m considering parking half my Vanguard in a high yield savings account and parking half my retirement account money in money market.

My FDIC-insured off-market money - 35% of my wealth - would be enough to live on for a couple years with no income.  Any advice is much appreciated in advance.  I understand I’m responsible for my own decisions, etc.

investing,How are you thinking about your portfolio given the outcome of the 2024 US Election?,"As the new Trump administration takes office in 2025, we will all grapple with a rapidly evolving economic landscape. The anticipated policies promise significant shifts reminiscent of Hungary's economic transformation.   Please let me know if you agree or disagree with any of the picks below...

# Understanding the Policy Shifts

**1. Economic Nationalism and Protectionism**

The administration's ""America First"" agenda is expected to:

* **Increase Tariffs on Imports**: Tariffs could rise by 10-25%, mainly targeting Chinese goods. This move aims to protect domestic industries but may lead to higher consumer prices.
* **Promote Onshoring**: Incentives for companies to relocate manufacturing to the U.S. could include tax breaks and subsidies.

**Impact Analysis:**

* **Beneficiaries**: Domestic manufacturers like **Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT)** and **3M Company (NYSE: MMM)** could see increased demand due to reduced competition from imports.
* **Potential Losers**: Companies reliant on imported materials or global supply chains like **Apple** may face higher production costs and supply-chain disruptions.

**2. Deregulation and Tax Cuts**

Anticipated measures include:

* **Corporate Tax Reductions**: Lowering the rate from 21% to 15% could significantly boost net earnings.
* **Deregulation Efforts**: Especially in energy and finance, rolling back regulations like Dodd-Frank could reshape industry operations.

**Impact Analysis:**

* **Financial Sector Gains**: Banks like **JPMorgan Chase** and **Goldman Sachs** might experience increased profitability due to relaxed lending regulations and lower taxes.
* **Energy Sector Surge**: Traditional oil and gas companies like **Exxon Mobil Corporation** and **Chevron Corporation** could benefit from reduced environmental regulations and expanded drilling rights.

**3. Increased Government Intervention**

Potential actions:

* **Sector-Specific Policies**: Favoring industries aligned with national priorities, possibly leading to subsidies for sectors like defense and infrastructure.
* **Unpredictable Regulatory Changes**: Sudden policy shifts could affect long-term planning and investment.

**Impact Analysis:**

* **Defense Contractors Advantage**: Companies like **Lockheed Martin** and **Northrop Grumman** may secure lucrative government contracts amid increased defense spending.
* **Risk of Cronyism**: Firms with close ties to the administration could outperform, while others may struggle to compete.

# What Lessons Can We Learn from Hungary Under Viktor Orbán

* **Nationalization and Heavy Taxation**: Foreign companies faced significant taxes, reducing foreign investment.
* **Favoritism Towards Domestic Firms**: Companies aligned with government objectives received advantages, distorting competition.
* **Market Volatility**: Unpredictable policies led to investor uncertainty and capital flight.

**Application to the U.S. Context:**

* **Regulatory Risk**: Investors should be wary of sudden policy changes that could impact sectors like technology and healthcare.
* **Importance of Government Relations**: Companies investing in government lobbying and aligning with national priorities may fare better.

# Sector-Specific Investment Opportunities and Risks

**1. Sectors Poised for Growth**

* **Energy Sector**
   * *Analysis*: With deregulation and a focus on energy independence, traditional energy companies will likely expand operations.
   * *Investment Picks*: Consider **Halliburton** for oilfield services and **Phillips 66** for refining and midstream operations.
   * *Commodities Impact*: Expect a potential rise in crude oil prices due to increased domestic demand, making investments in oil futures or ETFs like the **United States Oil Fund LP (NYSEARCA: USO)** attractive.
* **Financial Services**
   * *Analysis*: Deregulation could lead to increased lending and investment banking activities.
   * *Investment Picks*: Regional banks like **(NYSE: PNC)** may benefit from economic growth and deregulation.
* **Defense and Infrastructure**
   * *Analysis*: Increased government spending in defense and infrastructure projects.
   * *Investment Picks*: Infrastructure companies like **(NYSE: VMC)** and **Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM)** could see increased demand for construction materials.

**2. Sectors Facing Headwinds**

* **Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals**
   * *Analysis*: Potential reforms aiming to reduce drug prices could squeeze profit margins.
   * *Investment Risks*: Companies like **Pfizer** and **Merck** may face pricing pressures.
   * *Considerations*: Biotech firms focusing on innovative treatments may be less impacted.
* **Renewable Energy**
   * *Analysis*: A shift away from climate initiatives could reduce subsidies and support for renewable energy projects.
   * *Investment Risks*: Companies like **First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ: FSLR)** and **NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NEE)** might experience slowed growth.
   * *Commodities Impact*: Potential decrease in demand for renewable energy commodities like lithium and rare earth elements.
* **Technology and Multinationals**
   * *Analysis*: Tariffs and trade barriers could disrupt global supply chains.
   * *Investment Risks*: Tech giants like **Microsoft** and **Alphabet** might face international market challenges.

# Navigating Market Volatility

**Strategies to Mitigate Risks:**

* **Defensive Stocks**: Consider utilities and consumer staples companies like **The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE: PG)** and **Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE: DUK)**, which tend to be more stable during market fluctuations.
* **Gold and Precious Metals**: Historically seen as a haven, investing in gold through **SPDR Gold Shares (NYSEARCA: GLD)** or mining companies like **Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE: GOLD)** can hedge against volatility.

# Exploring International Investment Opportunities

**Emerging Markets Resilience:**

* **India**
   * *Analysis*: With a domestic solid growth trajectory, India is less exposed to U.S. policy changes.
   * *Investment Picks*: **HDFC Bank Limited (NYSE: HDB)** offers exposure to India's growing middle class.
* **Taiwan and South Korea**
   * *Analysis*: Key semiconductor and AI supply chain players are potentially insulated from U.S.-China trade tensions.
   * *Investment Picks*: **Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd**.

**Other Potential Diversification Plays:**

* **International ETFs**: Investing in funds like **iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSEARCA: EEM)** provides broad exposure to emerging markets.
* **Commodities**: Diversifying with commodities like copper and nickel, essential for global infrastructure and technology, can capitalize on international demand.",0,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gyxypj/how_are_you_thinking_about_your_portfolio_given/,new trump administration take office grapple rapidly evolving economic landscape

investing,Is buying Buying house > S&P 500? ,"So I was doing from research on how much money you can make if you had 73k $ living in idaho area. 
1. buying a property at that time
2. Invest in S & P 500 and wait for 20 years. 


Here are some calculations i came up with. 

1. Bought a house, if you bought a house for 73k 2004 your house price in 2024 would have been 350k~. Say your insurance is 1800$ yearly. What would be 36k after 20 years. Propert tax would be around 1% still comes to be 36k. 350k - 70k =280 K 

2. 73k worth S&P 500 would yield around 530k. If you sell 530k worth of stock and payed 15% tax = 450k. But you are still paying rent. I an average rent of say 1200$ per month. 
So you paid  1200$ x 12 months x 20 years = 288000$. That leaves you with 
450000 - 288000 =1,62,000. That’s just double of what you invested. 


In this case buying a house seems like a better idea.

investing,DCA Into multiple instruments,"Hey there,

I'm trying to learn the ropes on investing, and am working on my strategy. My plan is to put ~75% into an index (probably S&P 500) and leave the remaining 25% for more volatile, riskier trades. I'm young and all of the (limited) money I'll be investing is strictly left-over, so I'm very comfortable with any losses.

My first question is, does this sound like a sensible split?

And secondly, I plan to invest my left-over money monthly. I believe this is called dollar cost averaging, or at least will be an adaptation of it. So how do I decide how to split it across my instruments, considering that the initial 75/25 split won't remain constant once I make gains or losses. And, for my more volatile stocks, is it worth holding off and putting money in at times when they're lower?

I hope you'll forgive me if any of these questions seem silly.

investing,What do you guys think of target stock? (TGT),"They had a bad quarter and they just dropped 20%, but there's that old saying about buying when others are fearful, or buying good companies when theyre down. I believe they'll bounce back from the bad quarter. 

Anyways, theyre currently trading around $124.40, their average price target is $143. Their P/E (according to google) is 13.17 whereas the Consumer descretionary sector P/E average is ~28 according to this: https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/sector/consumer-discretionary/

They just seem like a good company that had a bad quarter.

Anyways the numbers look good to me but I'm a novice at best when it comes to stock investing.  So am i missing something?

investing,Should I convert my rollover IRA to a ROTH IRA? Taxes worth it? ,"Im 30 years old. This year I didn't work for 4 months. My gross for the year will probably be around 250k. Next year will probably be around 290-300k>. I rolled over my old 401ks from previous employers to a rollover IRA this year around 200k. Is it worth it to do a ROTH conversion from the rollover IRA? Tax free growth seems great for the next 30-35 years.

I was just wondering:

Should I convert my rollover IRA to a ROTH IRA?

1. If i did convert it, Should i convert the whole amount all at once? Or do some every year over a period of like 4 years. All the reading it says I should wait for a low income years.

2. Has anyone regret doing it because of the high tax you have to pay?

3. I always did a backdoor ROTH, but now if i keep this large amount in an IRA, ill pay double tax because the pro-rata rule. Is it still worth doing a backdoor Roth and just paying the tax again?

4. Or best to keep it in an IRA or transfer it to new employer 401k?

Let me know your thoughts!

investing,My mom (69) is asking me if she should invest in the stock market ,"My mom doesn’t make much money. She’s had enough where she can retire in a few years, but money will be tight. She recently started asking me about investing in the stock market because she’s hearing it’s going up. I told her that in my opinion at her age, if you invest in the stock market, you have to be prepared to lose it. Because even though the market will usually go back up, it might not come up  by the time that she needs it.

That said, I dont know much about investing and thought it would be worth asking here. With the stock market seeing gains, is it worth her investing 5-10k in the short term? Or is there a safer option. I was thinking eft’s, but again, I don’t know nearly as much as you all. 

I’m not sure how much she has in retirement saved. Most of it is through the Texas teachers retirement system, so it’s not a set amount $$, instead it’s based on the average salary of her final 5 years (which isn’t much)

investing,Understanding the Lifecycle of Mining Stocks,"I have recently had some pretty good luck with AI stocks picks, and I'd like to continue to expose myself to the trend of robotics and AI/Renewable energy by investing in some companies that harvest the raw materials used in the manufacture of those goods.  I have some questions about mining companies that I haven't been able to find any decent answers to online though, and I was hoping you all would have some resources to point me towards or best practices. 

1. I'm currently invested in $TMQ.  It's performing very well right now, though I have no idea why.  I am chalking it up to sentiment, U.S. located mine, and restricted copper supply.  $TMQ is an exploration company though.  Eventually, that company will need to actually mine the minerals, and my understanding is that the mining is done through a separate, new company.  Is there a standard practice to this?  Will there be a spin off, or will $TMQ create a wholly owned subsidiary and I will continue to hold just the one stock?  I assume this is an ""it depends"" situation, but is there a general case?  

  
2. Mining companies are unique in that even the best run mines have a shelf life (the amount of metals available in the land holdings).  How do mining companies dispense value to share holders over the life of the mine?  Are they generally high dividend stocks or is the impetus on me to sell at some magical valuation moment.  I doubt that the value of the stock is ownership in the underlying commodity, I just don't understand how the shareholder captures value, and what the timing of that capture is.

**SCHD - Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF**:

* **Expense Ratio**: 0.06%

investing,Novice Investor who needs to pick some investment options for my mom.  ,"Good day!  

I honestly know little about investing, but realizing I really need to learn for myself and family.  

Currently I am looking to re-invest some money for my mom.  An annuity of hers recently matured and she was recommended by her advisor to put it back into another annuity to avoid taxes/fees for now.  From what I understand, you can do a 1035 into a new annuity and all the money gets transferred, no taxes or fees get subtracted.  

Is this a good idea or should she be looking at something other than another annuity (even if she has to pay taxes to get the money out)? She made a decent return on this last one and doesn't need immediate access to this money (about $300k) - she is really just looking for a place to put it so it grows and doesn't just sit there.  

Her house is paid for and she has few monthly expenses and checking/savings accounts that should have more than enough to support her.  

Right now her advisor recommended a New York Life Premier VA  and a Brighthouse Shield Level II VA.  I am not hearing a lot of positives on VAs so was just wondering good alternatives for someone with money already in a matured VA and is just looking for a conservative way to grow that money for a few years.

investing,SEC Chair Gary Gensler to Depart Agency on January 20,"Washington D.C., Nov. 21, 2024 —

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that its 33rd Chair, Gary Gensler, will step down from the Commission effective at 12:00 pm on January 20, 2025. Chair Gensler began his tenure on April 17, 2021, in the immediate aftermath of the GameStop market events. He led the agency through a robust rulemaking agenda to enhance efficiency, resiliency, and integrity in the U.S. capital markets. He also oversaw high-impact enforcement cases to hold wrongdoers accountable and return billions to harmed investors.

“The Securities and Exchange Commission is a remarkable agency,” said Chair Gensler. “The staff and the Commission are deeply mission-driven, focused on protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and ensuring that the markets work for investors and issuers alike. The staff comprises true public servants. It has been an honor of a lifetime to serve with them on behalf of everyday Americans and ensure that our capital markets remain the best in the world.

“I thank President Biden for entrusting me with this incredible responsibility. The SEC has met our mission and enforced the law without fear or favor. I’ve greatly enjoyed working with my fellow Commissioners, Allison Herren Lee, Elad Roisman, Hester Peirce, Caroline Crenshaw, Mark Uyeda, and Jaime Lizárraga. I also thank Congress, my colleagues across the U.S. government, and fellow regulators around the world.”

**Treasury Markets**

During Chair Gensler’s tenure, the SEC adopted critical enhancements to the $28 trillion U.S. Treasury markets. To lower cost and risk in the Treasury markets, the agency adopted rules to promote central clearing and narrow circumstances in which broker-dealers are exempt from national securities association registration. These reforms will lower risk and enhance efficiency throughout the entirety of the U.S. capital markets.

**Equity Markets**

Under Chair Gensler, the SEC made the first significant updates to the $55 trillion U.S. equity market in nearly 20 years. The agency unanimously made updates to the National Market System so that stocks can be traded more efficiently with narrower spreads and lower fees. Improvements also include shortening the settlement cycle to one day, which is good for investors and lowers risk in the market. Further, the agency unanimously adopted rules to update information regarding brokers’ execution quality. These reforms benefit investors by making equity markets more efficient.

**Resiliency**

The Commission adopted amendments during Chair Gensler’s tenure regarding Form PF, the confidential reporting form for certain SEC-registered investment advisers to private funds. The amended rules require that large hedge fund and private equity fund advisers make current reports on certain events to the Commission. The SEC further amended Form PF jointly with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to improve the quality of the information the agencies receive from all Form PF filers, and those changes will be implemented next year. Finally, the Commission adopted reforms to money market funds to make them more resilient, liquid, and transparent, including in times of stress.

**Corporate Governance**

To better promote trust in the capital markets, the SEC under Chair Gensler adopted a number of changes regarding corporate governance, including updating the rules for when corporate insiders can sell their shares, for when executives have to give back compensation based on erroneously reported financials, and for disclosure of executive pay versus performance. The agency also adopted new rules to allow shareholders to vote their preferred mix of board candidates on universal proxy cards in contested director elections. Additionally, the Commission adopted rules requiring more timely disclosure by those who are seeking control and buy more than a 5 percent stake in a company.

**Disclosure**

Since April 2021, the Commission has adopted several rules to ensure that investors get the disclosure they need from public companies and companies seeking to go public, broker-dealers, and investment advisors.

First, the Commission adopted rules to enhance disclosure around public company issuers’ cyber and climate risks, as well as for those companies seeking to go public via a special purpose acquisition company. The rules are grounded in materiality, as investors need this information to make buying, selling, holding, and voting decisions.

Second, the Commission adopted rules requiring certain broker-dealers and investment advisers to notify customers of data breaches that might put personal information at risk.

Finally, the Commission enhanced transparency to the markets by regularly publishing aggregate, anonymized data regarding registered investment funds, private funds, and investment advisers.

**Accounting and Auditing**

During Chair Gensler’s tenure, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), overseen by the SEC, successfully negotiated a Statement of Protocol with Chinese market authorities to allow the PCAOB to fully inspect and investigate, for the first time, the auditors of China-related companies listed in the United States. For the last two years, the PCAOB has been able to fulfill its inspection and enforcement-related responsibilities as it relates to audit firms in China and Hong Kong.

Further, in April 2021, the PCAOB had only updated five of the standards it adopted on an interim basis when it was created 20 years ago. The interim standards had been carried over from existing American Institute of Certified Public Accountants standards, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act envisioned that the PCAOB would update them soon after its creation. Since Chair Gensler was sworn in, the PCAOB has updated 18 interim standards and two other standards to reflect the current oversight needs in accounting and auditing.

**Examinations and Enforcement**

The Divisions of Enforcement and Examinations, which make up about half of the agency, have been steadfast cops on the beat during Chair Gensler’s tenure. The agency received more than 145,000 tips, complaints, and referrals and awarded approximately $1.5 billion to whistleblowers. The Commission filed more than 2,700 enforcement actions and obtained approximately $21 billion in penalties and disgorgement orders. Between fiscal years 2021 and 2024, the agency returned more than $2.7 billion to harmed investors as a result of enforcement actions.

Further, the SEC recovered more than $250 million for harmed investors through examination of investment advisors, investment companies, and broker dealers, among others. The Division of Examinations also enhanced communication with registrants by sharing more timely information about its annual priorities and observations and proactively engaging with industry and other regulators.

Under Chair Gensler, the Commission continued the work Chair Jay Clayton began to protect investors in the crypto markets. During Chair Gensler’s tenure, the agency brought actions against crypto intermediaries for fraud, wash trading, registration violations, and other misconduct.

In the last full fiscal year, according to the SEC’s Office of the Inspector General, 18 percent of the SEC’s tips, complaints, and referrals were crypto-related, despite the crypto markets comprising less than 1 percent of the U.S. capital markets. Court after court [agreed](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/gensler-remarks-pli-s-56th-annual-institute-securities-regulation-111424#_ftn37) with the Commission’s actions to protect investors and rejected all arguments that the SEC cannot enforce the law when securities are being offered—whatever their form.

**About Chair Gensler**

Chair Gensler was formerly Chair of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, leading the Obama Administration’s reform of the $400 trillion swaps market. He also was senior advisor to U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes in writing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002) and was undersecretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance and assistant secretary of the Treasury from 1997-2001.

In recognition for his service, Chair Gensler was awarded the Alexander Hamilton Award, the U.S. Treasury’s highest honor. He is a recipient of the 2014 Frankel Fiduciary Prize.

Before joining the SEC, Chair Gensler was professor of the Practice of Global Economics and Management at the MIT Sloan School of Management, co-director of MIT’s Fintech@CSAIL, and senior advisor to the MIT Media Lab Digital Currency Initiative. From 2017-2019, he served as chair of the Maryland Financial Consumer Protection Commission.

Earlier in his career, Chair Gensler worked at Goldman Sachs, where he became a partner in the Mergers & Acquisition department, headed the firm’s Media Group, led fixed income & currency trading in Asia, and was co-head of Finance, responsible for the firm's worldwide Controllers and Treasury efforts.

A native of Baltimore, Md., Chair Gensler earned his undergraduate degree in economics in 1978 and his MBA from The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, in 1979. He has three daughters.

investing,Advice on what to do with insurance policy funds,"My father recently transferred ownership of a life insurance policy to me that he started when I was just a year old. To my understanding, it’s a variable permanent life insurance policy, and I now have full control of it. The current beneficiaries are my father and my sister.

I’ve been seeking advice on what to do with this policy. One suggestion I received was to transfer it via a 1035 exchange into a variable annuity. However, I’m hesitant about this option because I dislike the idea of having limited access to my funds until retirement and having them managed by an external company.

At this stage in my life, my investments are structured primarily for growth. I’m 23, with no dependents or immediate plans for large purchases in the next few years. That said, I’d like to position myself to use some of my portfolio’s gains toward a down payment on a home in the future.

Currently, I’m considering cashing out the policy, paying the associated capital gains tax, and reallocating the funds into a taxable brokerage account, where I can invest in a mix of ETFs or index funds to maintain flexibility and control.

Here’s a summary of how I’ve structured my investments:
• Roth IRA (maxed yearly, with VOO and QQQ holdings)
• VTSAX 
• 401(k)
• High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA)
• Some cryptocurrency
• Individual blue-chip stocks


Given that I already actively manage my investments and have a clear plan, I’m leaning toward cashing out rather than transferring to a variable annuity. However, I’d appreciate any insights or alternative perspectives you might have. It’s possible there are aspects of this decision that I haven’t fully considered since I am still learning as I grow.

investing,My philosophy on investing in real estate vs stocks...would like to hear opinions,"TL,DR: If forecasted first-year cash flow on a property exceeds that of the stock market (\~6% COC return, inflation-adjusted), I think that's a green flag to buy a property...because cash flow should get better each year with mortgage paydown.

Full details...

26 year old guy, single, no kids, renter, no debt, good net worth/financial cushion. Current asset allocation is \~70/30 stocks/bonds.

So...I'm planning to begin replacing bonds, then eventually stocks, with real estate. Obviously...the math has the math out for it to be worth it, because of the low liquidity of real estate. The hard metric that I use to make decisions is inflation-adjusted cash-on-cash return (appreciation is a nice bonus of real estate). 

Adjusted for inflation, I think \~6% is a reasonable annual ROI to expect from the stock market...so my philosophy is that my first year COC return should be \~6%+ (since real estate appreciation should ""offset"" inflation"") for it to be worth replacing stocks with real estate (or possibly a bit higher, due to capital gains taxes from selling index funds). With mortgage paydown, the ""6%"" should go up each year, but the low liquidity of real estate scares me a bit...and who knows if we're near a housing bubble. 

Would like to hear fellow investors' philosophies on choosing to invest in stocks vs real estate.

investing,"Target vs Dollar Tree, both, or neither","Both of these have experienced a significant drawdown on shifting customer preferences, price sensitivity, and a migration to alternatives and/or competitors such as Walmart.

Still, there is a market for both that is robust. For Target, while there has been a shift in the customers toward Wal-Mart as the middle income group became more cost conscious and there is still opportunity for longer-term profitability.

Dollar Tree seems to have a more acute challenge with a down market customer and not a lot of room to push through pricing. Also, the product mix is not composed of necessity items generally speaking, but more discretionary items that can be forgone while focusing budgetary resources of cost effective food items elsewhere.

Gold miners GDX PE 31, 

consumer staples XLP PE 31, yeild 2.6

BRK which has a PE of 9.6 (but what does that really mean with BRK anyway)

money market which is getting about 4.5% right now with fidelity.  

  
I was thinking 50% in brk, then 25% money markets, then split the rest 

  
i worried about the consumer staples and gold miners funds though, because if i believe the PEs will fall, these fund is aready around 30, so may not be great.

I hope this is the right sub for this...

I (31 year old, male) am looking to set myself up for success and retirement, and have been reading lots of blogs and books about future planning. One of the main things I hear (and read) is that ""the first 100k is the hardest part"" and that from there momentum and time will begin working in your favor at an exponential rate. But, I am not sure what that means...

Does that mean the first $100k in your retirement savings aka 401k/ 403b? Does that mean first $100k in stocks outside of a 401k/ 403b? Or does that mean a $100k value in some other manner like stock holdings outside of non tax advantaged vehicles?

I have worked both in the for profit and non profit industries so have both a 401k AND a 403b that combine to a value of $103,000. Just over $100k. Yay! Does that mean I have hit the elusive first benchmark of $100k? 

Moving forward, I will continue to push as much of my income as possible into my retirement but I am curious if there is something else I should be thinking about. Any clarity or insights is appreciated.

investing,Investing in What You Know: Modern Tools for Finding Hidden Gems,"In 'One Up On Wall Street' (great book, highly recommend) Peter Lynch emphasizes the idea of ""investing in what you know"". Specifically, he talks about how some of his best investing ideas initially came from a friend or family member raving about a particular product:

>*""Taco Bell, I was impressed with the burrito on a trip to California; La Quinta Motor Inns, somebody at the rival Holiday Inn told me about it; Volvo, my family and friends drive this car; Apple Computer, my kids had one at home and then the systems manager bought several for the office; Service Corporation International, a Fidelity electronics analyst (who had nothing to do with funeral homes, so this wasn’t his field) found on a trip to Texas; Dunkin’ Donuts, I loved the coffee; and recently the revamped Pier 1 Imports, recommended by my wife. In fact, Carolyn is one of my best sources. She’s the one who discovered L’eggs.”*

According to Lynch, this is the key advantage retail investors have over Wall Street: spotting great products and brands in their daily lives, often long before they arrive on an Investment analyst's desk.

I'm wondering whether this process can be modernised, and expanded.

One challenge I face, for instance, is that I don’t live in the U.S., so the American products I notice are often already global, and likely already on Wall Street’s radar. This limits my ability to discover the kind of early opportunities Lynch described if I want to invest in American companies. 

Same goes for brands in Asia or Africa—surely there are great companies out there, future ten-baggers, but many of us won't come across simply because we're not exposed to their products, and by the time we are we've missed the boat.

I’m curious if people know of tools or methods to help identify these hidden gems. 

Perhaps something like an online product rating site or resource for finding universally loved brands that haven’t gone mainstream yet. I’ve thought about using tools like Amazon's “top rated” section, but reviews can be manipulated, and often it's just Chinese tat you can't invest in. I also checked out r/buyitforlife, but it’s not quite what I'm after.

Thoughts?

investing,Recency bias or has something fundamentally changed?,"So, ever since I started investing, back in 2019 I have read doom and gloom predictions of bear markets and stock market crashes and how valuations were too high. Now I know better that simple valuations does not predict stock price movements alone. But I believe that we live in strange times... It is humbling to see the 90 year history of the S&P500: [https://www.macrotrends.net/2324/sp-500-historical-chart-data](https://www.macrotrends.net/2324/sp-500-historical-chart-data)

The stock market has always been trending upwards and bear markets have had just a tiny effect, but inflation adjusted paints a whole another picture. In the worst case scenario, 20 years could pass and you  lost all value to inflation (not including dividends). The amazing returns we have seen in the past 1.5 decades is more the exception than the norm. But it is also curious to see that we have not had any major recession since 2007-2008, that is 17 years this 2025!! (I would not count COVID here, since it was very short, and it is not something linked to the economy). You can see how the frequency of recessions have been going down over time... [https://collabfund.com/blog/its-been-a-while/](https://collabfund.com/blog/its-been-a-while/) . So there is clearly a difference in the economy.

But the economy is not all, there is also psychology. Nowadays more people invest than ever before because of low cost and increased accessibility. This means that new investors have a recency bias towards bull markets and good economic conditions. The stock market rallied after Trump election given his promises to lower corporate tax rates and lower regulations, but anyone who has an understanding of economics will realize that what he wants to achieve and what he promises to do is contradictory. Mass deportations and high tariffs are not good for the economy either. Are investors too focused on the short term to see the long term effects? I am not pro-Kamala Harris either, don't get me wrong.

Given that there have been no major recessions since 2007, I also think this could explain the massive success of growth over value. The world has clearly changed since Charlie Munger's time. Do you think this is something to last, or are we living an economic mirage? What retrospective explanations do we have to explain the apparent stability we have been living? And yet, not everybody feels like they are doing better economically. What could break this stability? Does higher stock prices mean lower returns in the decades to come?

Our electric bill in California is outrageous because of the utility company named PG&E, which is a public company.

I was having a conversation with him a couple days ago where he told me he owned “way too many stocks”.

“Cramer, a real smart man that knows a thing or two, say you should never own more than 10 stocks”

I explained that horrible advice and that he must be misunderstanding. He of course defiantly responded about a “difference of opinion” but when I went to look it up to debunk it, I found some quotes that make it sound like Cramer might ACTUALLY be saying this to his retail viewers!?

investing,Should I move my USD to EUR now that I live full time in France?,"Hello all, I'm hoping this is the right place/way to ask this.

I have almost zero knowledge about stocks, investments, etc. 5 years ago I moved to France from the US, and it is safe to say that I will not be moving back to the US. I'm working, married with a French woman, have a daughter. I have moved my entire life over here.

We are looking to buy a house here, and I am thinking that now is a good time to move my investments and USD to EUR. I was hoping for some advice. Also, general advice, as I see the USD is strong at the moment, buying 0.95€.

I have the following accounts:

* liquid/checking/savings: $1k, I've already been using this
* Invesco: $33k
* HSA: $7k
* 401k: $19k
* IRA: $3k

Moving Invesco incurs no fees, so that is a simpler question of just ""will it grow even more in the next few months?"". I'm leaning towards no, and to just go ahead and transfer that over, as an investment in a larger down payment for a house seems like a wiser choice.

The other accounts are all small retirement accounts. I know I would be hit with fees for withdrawing from them, but part of me wants to just go ahead and pull the money out and rip the bandaid off. what is more valuable, that $7k right now toward a house, or that money as and HSA in 32 years?

Or is that being too short-sighted? And it would actually be best to keep an investment vehicle in USD? Or save those retirement accounts for another 32 years (I'm currently 33)?

investing,Conservative strategy assuming volatile markets and chaotic policies and regulating? ,"TL;DR: Given the current volatility and uncertainty explained in more detail below, and my conservative risk profile, I am looking at (1) 1-3 year bond laddering probably through ~~defined term~~ target maturity bond ETF's, (2) defined outcome equity ETF's, and (3) some conservative equity ETF's. What are your thoughts on this strategy given the risk profile, and AIO or overthinking it?  
(regarding my thoughts on volatility and uncertainty - let's assume what I say below. I think discussion of this aspect should be in a separate post/thread - it is really interesting and really complex, and probably controversial and emotional. )

I am a conservative investor looking for capital preservation, inflation protection, and some value investing for the longer term. I am retired. I am fortunate. I have done well through my 401K, some investing outside of that, and tactical money management (e.g. refinancing mortgages, leveraging equity, simple lifestyle).  
(although I've missed some opportunities like Roth IRAs, I have benefited from my benign neglect investing strategy all those working years - index investing weighted towards equities, value investing, invest and forget - don't look at it more than once a month.

Assume for this question the markets will be volatile  
\- They might go up initially early in 2025 (both stocks and bonds) because of continuation of current economic activity and policies (lower inflation, stable employment, Fed rate small cuts, stable GDP increases, rising profits, Trump bump).  
\- But will go down (both stocks and bonds) because of chaos in government and changes in guiding principles and policies, rising inflation because of tariffs and bad policies and chaos, and eventually a downturn or worse.  
\- However, maybe the Street and bond vigilantes will force some better policies and more stability.

As a conservative investor in retirement, I am thinking of some combination of the following strategy (while not getting totally out of the market index ETFs):

1. Bond laddering (likely with ~~defined term~~ target maturity ETF's, high quality or even just treasuries) for 1, 2, and 3 year terms. This gives me some stability in yield if rates go down (e.g. 3 year terms), and some yield increase opportunities if interest rates go up (e.g. 1 year terms, or at the end of the 3 year terms). This likely keeps me above the inflation rate overall, and capital preservation with high quality, and income, no matter what the markets do. (I indicate ETF's because then I don't have to manage it and I have lots of options for terms, but with treasuries I might do that with actual bonds because they are relatively low effort to roll over, maybe even automatically?)
2. Stock buffer ETF's (defined outcome ETF's). This gives me equity upside although capped, and downside protection at least for the most likely downside (although I've even heard unlimited downside protection is out there too; haven't investigated yet). This provides capital preservation and rising market opportunities, no matter what the markets are doing. edit: I forgot a key aspect. These are typically term bounded to one or two years, and reset at the end of the term with new conditions. 
3. Conservative stock ETF's - utilities, dividends (quality), consumer staples, and broad market indexes although at a lower allocation than 2. This enables larger market opportunities, and risks less on the downside near term. In my world, these will be the 'alternatives' in my portfolio",0,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gwr6hj/conservative_strategy_assuming_volatile_markets/,tldr given current volatility uncertainty explained detail conservative risk profile looking year bond laddering probably defined term target maturity bond etf defined outcome equity etf conservative equity etf thought strategy given risk profile aio overthinking regarding thought volatility uncertainty let assume say think discussion aspect separate postthread really interesting really complex probably controversial emotional conservative investor looking capital preservation inflation protection value investing longer term retired fortunate done well k investing outside tactical money management eg refinancing mortgage leveraging equity simple lifestyle although ive missed opportunity like roth ira benefited benign neglect investing strategy working year index investing weighted towards equity value investing invest forget dont look month assume question market volatile might go initially early stock bond continuation current economic activity policy lower inflation stable employment fed rate small cut stable gdp increase rising profit trump bump go stock bond chaos government change guiding principle policy rising inflation tariff bad policy chaos eventually downturn worse however maybe street bond vigilante force better policy stability conservative investor retirement thinking combination following strategy getting totally market index etf bond laddering likely defined term target maturity etf high quality even treasury year term give stability yield rate go eg year term yield increase opportunity interest rate go eg year term end year term likely keep inflation rate overall capital preservation high quality income matter market indicate etf dont manage lot option term treasury might actual bond relatively low effort roll maybe even automatically stock buffer etf defined outcome etf give equity upside although capped downside protection least likely downside although ive even heard unlimited downside protection havent investigated yet provides capital preservation rising market opportunity matter market edit forgot key aspect typically term bounded one two year reset end term new condition conservative stock etf utility dividend quality consumer staple broad market index although lower allocation enables larger market opportunity risk le downside near term world alternative portfolio,0.023506155303030307,Positive

investing,A Conversation On Collectables ,"I'm sure this won't come as news to anyone, but if you invest in collectables and other physical assets, I hope you take time to reevaluate the market for your items as time goes on and make no assumptions.

I mention this because I've been helping aging family members convert chunks of their physical estates to cash to have in their twilight years, and tons of stuff they thought had value (because at one point it did) did quite poorly in the end. Luckily they weren't dependent on the funds from this, but was still a bummer after holding on to it for decades. There's a shrinking market for so much of this stuff as the older generations become net sellers and younger generations have no interest in it, not to mention tighter economic conditions, etc.

Out of curiosity, what collectables do you think will stand the test of time and never lose value, if not continue to increase?

wallstreetbets,Tried to gamble my way out of debt - Didn’t work :(,"Well here it goes. 

About a year ago I dumped about 5k into a company that I may or may not have had private knowledge of. I thought I was so smart, turns out that less than a month later all my shares are worthless because the company filed for bankruptcy. 

Fast forward a couple months and my position was eliminated and I have been searching for jobs but been unemployed ever since. That 5k was a big chunk of my savings and with being unemployed and having bills to pay I quickly ran out of cash. I racked up about 12,000 in credit card debt and needed money fast. 

So naturally, I started gambling. I gambled by using this same credit card on some sketchy online casino, I didn’t deposit much at once, usually only $100 or so, but man I realized I had a gambling addiction once I spent over 4k on this site. I was making the money back but then I was chasing my losses and lost it all. 

Then autopay resumed on my card and tried to charge my entire balance which I didn’t have and Amex canceled my card. I was still making my monthly payments before that. 

So now I’m 16k in debt on this card, 3k on another, and have about $100 to my name. I sold my computers and guns and anything worth money but now I don’t know how I am going to pay my bills this month. 

Guys, please be careful, be honest with yourselves, casino gambling and options gambling are both just as dangerous. You have to limit yourself or else you are a few bad days away from being like me. 

I don’t know what I’m gonna do anymore but I thought I’d leave a warning for other degenerate gamblers like me.

wallstreetbets,MRNA Turnaround,"What’s up guys?  Check my profile if you want to see the original MRNA post.  I honestly couldn’t be happier with how today played out.  After a promising open, we saw a big shakeout as we dumped from 43.85 to 41.50.  We made a beautiful triple bottom there, and steadily climbed the rest of the day to finish  up 2.81% at 44.30.  Seeing buyers step in here like that is very encouraging, and it seems like the selling is over, at least in the short term.

On the daily, the trend line is broken in my opinion.  Decent volume, more than Thursday and Friday, but I’d like to see more like what we saw early last week.  But seeing a strong green candle close near the high of the day like that to break the trend is very encouraging to me.   On the hourly, I’m seeing an incredibly clean bull flag.  I’m also seeing the 50 day EMA ready to cross above the 100 day EMA.  This is very significant to me.  The last time that happened was on April 23.  The stock traded at 104 on that day, and ran to 168 by May 24.  I’m really hoping other traders see this cross and trend line break, and we get a big influx of volume tomorrow/rest of the week.  I’m sure most of you remember, but MRNA was one of THE meme stocks during covid.  When this thing picks up volume, it can make some insane daily swings, and it’s super fun to trade.  

The options data is still super bullish as well.  The put/call ratio on the volume was 0.17 today(extremely bullish).  The open interest is 0.28(very bullish).    My 45 calls are clearly the favorite here.  I highly doubt that is all WSB regards.  Someone else sees the same setup.  

According to their website, they are going to release their CMV vacccine phase 3 data before the end of the year.  If the data is positive, that could be a huge boost for their revenue, and therefore their stock price.  Our beloved Pharma Bro agrees with that sentiment, and recently called the stock a buy on his stream.   I’m wondering if someone thinks they’ll release the data this week, and that it’ll have a positive impact on the price.  

Some concerns:  CMV data being bad = tank.  They could also pull a Ryan Cohen and do a stock offering on a very positive day.  I’ve found some conflicting numbers, but it seems their cash on hand is around 11-12 billion.  Pretty solid, but they’re burning almost a billion a quarter.  This could ruin any potential big runs(at least temporarily, screwing short term call holders).  Also, it could just start going back in the shitter for no reason like it’s been doing for months and this is just another dead cat bounce.  


I noticed some interesting developments over the weekend as well.  The number of very recent articles about avian flu is surprising.  I can’t link articles here for some reason, but just search and you’ll be surprised.  I believe 55 people have been infected so far, and a lot of milk/egg products have been contaminated.  The cases have been mild, but mutations can occur rapidly.   Back in July, the government gave MRNA 176 million dollars to research an avian flu vaccine.  Given their relationship from Covid, I think MRNA is very well positioned to make significant money if this becomes a bigger problem.
That might be why the stock is seeing more interest.  

As for me, I’m still holding my 12/6 45c’s.  I’m going to see what tomorrow brings. I’m cautiously optimistic.  I have a feeling we see $45 tomorrow, but I’m watching $46.  Thats where it was rejected a week ago.  If we break that, then back test and hold, I’ll be very happy.  My calls are currently up 30% because i bought on Friday.  If i can get 100% or better, It’ll be hard not to sell.  If you’re holding calls, consider the concern I laid out and make your own decision.  Pay attention to the volume tomorrow and Wednesday, that will be key.  None of this is financial advice, just sharing my own thoughts.

wallstreetbets,$PL - Earth Data to Become Increasingly Valuable Under Trump Administration,"Alright, cat has gotten out of the bag while I have been writing this and Planet Labs is no longer a secret. This analysis is not written by ChatGPT, hopefully not nauseatingly sales-y, and has no regarded emojis or over the top use of “To the Moon”. No frills, just my take on where I think there is deep value.

**Overview:**  
Earth observation data as a business has long struggled to be profitable. It requires significant CAPEX, is high risk (strapping a cam to a rocket essentially), and the R+D on a lot of the imaging can be pretty exorbitant. The main leader in the space, Planet Labs, went public in the SPAC boom. As a whole, they’ve underperformed the promises they presented in their first prospectus. Planet Labs sought to be a ""One to Many"" data provider, and their main selling point was that earth data could be widely commercialized. While this is still fundamentally true, in the time since going public they have essentially become a government contractor (75% revenue from some form of government with only a quarter from general business use) (source: Q2 Investor Presentation). Revenue being sourced primarily from the government is two sides of the same coin and the value lies in the eye of the beholder: it's bad because they are too reliant on too few customers, or that government revenue is extremely sticky and a major growth driver under the right administration. I am of the latter opinion.

I think we are at an inflection point that could cause Planet Labs to become far more profitable than they are currently, which will cause their valuation to adjust higher (far higher than even their recent run-up). While the use cases for the their data is very broad, it has become evident in the last few years that the most profitable one is government use.

**My thesis lies in the following:**

1. Donny and a Republican majority House/Senate will have a much larger Defense and Intelligence budget. They will be willing to pay a premium to obtain top tier defense and intelligence data from vendors like $PL.
2. NATO contract is highly promising (https://spacenews.com/planet-signs-deal-with-nato-to-supply-satellite-imagery/) and is a first of its kind deal. Follow-on mandates to come if $PL executes.
3. Launch of Tanager-1 (a first of its kind methane specific tracking satellite - highly valuable for int'l governments seeking to gather data on parties with the most harmful emissions) and subsequent release of data should bolster top-line (new sales team will hopefully execute).

Also before you ask, why can’t RKLB, SpaceX, etc. just strap cameras to their rockets? Or why can’t Starlink tack some cameras on their satellites? Boiled down most simply: they can’t do it efficiently or cost-effectively. They’d have to divert time and resources away from their primary businesses (which already have their own significant challenges) just to fight an uphill battle; this can be discussed more at length if clarity is needed but I just don’t see it as a likely scenario. Generally speaking this would more likely materialize as a continued symbiotic relationship (Planet Labs uses SpaceX rockets to launch their satellite constellations for example).

**Other thoughts:**  
Larger market cap compared to closest peer, no debt, invests more heavily in development of new technologies (I view this as a plus long term - they understand that earth images can be commoditized and are spending heavily to develop a suite of analytics products which can materially enhance user experience - this will create competitive advantage long-term; and yes before you ask, their data is being used to train AI models - see Laconic deal today - perfect example of their R+D spend beginning to pay off), recently trimmed workforce (leaner operating structure), largest and highest-quality satellite fleet (and it's not even close - actually a staggering difference), multiple partnerships with Google (Google owns \~12%), rumors are circling that they will finally announce positive adj EBITDA either this quarter or next (management has been targeting Q4)

**Position and Price Target**:  
I am planning to update this and positions continuously; I do believe in the growth of PL and will likely add on. May roll the 12/20’s, not decided yet.

Position:  
12/20/2025 $5C 9x  
12/20/2025 $5C 4x

Target: $PL 5/1/2025: $10/share

**TLDR:**  
Earth data used for defense and intelligence will become significantly more valuable over the next year due to major administrative tailwinds. Donny's Department of Defense will award more government contracts at a higher value, which will finally let them scale in the way they were meant to (R+D, Capex, and cash burn from last few years will all be justified by a stronger top-line). The mature business model for $PL is essentially a software company with high gross margins. The margin expansion will finally be realized as more contracts are awarded and valuations will correct accordingly. Additionally, while they do seek to serve a wide array of industries (i.e. agriculture, natural resources, etc.) the biggest short term tailwinds (I think) will be defense and intelligence contracts.

They signed a NATO contract recently.

>NATO and satellite imagery firm Planet Labs have signed a contract for a “virtual” constellation of surveillance, intelligence, and reconnaissance space assets—the latest sign of NATO’s growing reliance on commercial space capabilities. 

>The contract is the first under the Alliance Persistent Surveillance from Space (APSS) program, [launched by NATO early in 2023](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_211793.htm), in which 17 member states including the U.S. agreed to pool and distribute intelligence and surveillance data culled from both from national and commercial satellites.

wallstreetbets,RDDT Bull Case.,"I am here to present my bull case for Reddit stock (ticker RDDT). I am basing my thesis on a projected 100-280 billion dollar market cap as per my calculations. 

Reddit is taking on a lot of initiatives at once and is so far executing on all of them. Since their IPO in march Reddit has been making strides in but not limited to:

- Enhancing their search algorithm
- Creating more efficient and better optimised advertisement infrastructure
- Increasing visibility on Google search becoming the 6th most visited site (Reddit is taking over FAST)
- Licensing their data to AI companies like Google and Microsoft (this is a growing market and with the uncertainty of the tech landscape data licensing can very well become a trillion dollar industry)
- Reddit has been implementing machine translation to over 35 different languages which has caused a notable increase in unique visitors internationally (still growing)

If Reddit is to continue excelling in the 5 major pillars mentioned above then a 100-280 Billion dollar market cap is justifiable. The way I rationalise it is this. Google is a very moderately priced company with P/E ratios much lower than their big tech counterparts. 

With Google search being 80 percent of their business in terms of revenue and profits I believe that Reddit being the 6th most popular site on Google commands a valuation that is a bit under 1/6th of 80 percent of the valuation of Google (280B) but not drastically undervalued like its current 25 billion dollar market cap.

wallstreetbets,Truth behind the MSTR Convertible Bond Arbitrage delta neutral gamma trading strategy to buy BTC,"A lot of people on here are enticed to enter MSTR because of the juicy premiums and some folks wanted a more detailed explanation of what's going on and how Saylor is raising money paying zero coupons. Having worked in the Institutional fund side for awhile here's a little bit of insight.

What's happening is what is called a ""Convertible Bond Arbitrage delta neutral gamma trading strategy"" its a handful huh

Here Capital allocators such as hedge funds can trade around this option, which is essentially a very “out of the money” (OTM) option, by taking a “delta neutral” position. In other words, when these arbitrageurs buy the convertible bond, they simultaneously short a certain amount of the company's shares, making them delta neutral.

Lets take this example ...assume that these convertible bonds are issued with a delta of 0.5. To achieve a delta-neutral position, the hedge fund would short $500 worth of MicroStrategy stock for every $1000 worth of convertible bonds owned. As MicroStrategy stock rises and the option is more “in the money” (ITM), the hedge fund sells more MicroStrategy stock to remain delta neutral. When the convertible is well in the money, the delta for these traders typically approaches 1. At this point, the hedge fund is typically long $1000 worth of convertibles and short $1000 worth of MicroStrategy, which basically cancels out to 0.

The opposite is also true because when the stock falls, the hedge funds cover more of their short shares or buy shares to maintain their delta-neutral position. In this sense, these hedge funds are buying low and selling high, trading around the volatility of the stock and simply being long-gamma. This is probably also the reason why the short interest is so high at 14.41%.

We would go so far as to say that these convertible bondholders probably don't care about Bitcoin or where MicroStrategy shares are trading when conducting their arbitrage, as long as there is enough volatility to trade around. Remember that these capital allocators are likely delta neutral but net long gamma.

Reminder that these types of trades are very complicated and have to be continuously rebalanced to remain ""delta neutral"" so they can trade around this volatility... we dont have access to the type of market makers or financial products they have to make this possible.",48,72,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h4yn3z/truth_behind_the_mstr_convertible_bond_arbitrage/,lot people enticed enter mstr juicy premium folk wanted detailed explanation whats going saylor raising money paying zero coupon worked institutional fund side awhile here little bit insight whats happening called convertible bond arbitrage delta neutral gamma trading strategy handful huh capital allocator hedge fund trade around option essentially money otm option taking delta neutral position word arbitrageur buy convertible bond simultaneously short certain amount company share making delta neutral let take example assume convertible bond issued delta achieve deltaneutral position hedge fund would short worth microstrategy stock every worth convertible bond owned microstrategy stock rise option money itm hedge fund sell microstrategy stock remain delta neutral convertible well money delta trader typically approach point hedge fund typically long worth convertible short worth microstrategy basically cancel opposite also true stock fall hedge fund cover short share buy share maintain deltaneutral position sense hedge fund buying low selling high trading around volatility stock simply longgamma probably also reason short interest high would go far say convertible bondholder probably dont care bitcoin microstrategy share trading conducting arbitrage long enough volatility trade around remember capital allocator likely delta neutral net long gamma reminder type trade complicated continuously rebalanced remain delta neutral trade around volatility dont access type market maker financial product make possible,0.05267063492063494,Positive

wallstreetbets,"CHINA BAD, BABA GOOD [DD]","**CHINA BAD**

With that out of the way, let's discuss our favorite Chinese company: Alibaba ($BABA).

Alibaba is China's largest e-commerce company and technology conglomerate.

They operate the following businesses:

|Category|Business|Description|
|:-|:-|:-|
|E-Commerce|Taobao|China’s largest consumer-to-consumer (C2C) marketplace|
|E-Commerce|Tmall|B2C platform for brands and businesses targeting Chinese consumers|

|Logistics|Cainiao|Logistics and supply chain network to support Alibaba's e-commerce platforms|
|Digital Media & Entertainment|Youku|Video streaming platform similar to YouTube|
|Digital Media & Entertainment|Alibaba Pictures|Film production and distribution company​|
|Digital Media & Entertainment|Damai|Event ticketing platform|
|Financial Services|Ant Group|Parent company of Alipay, which offers mobile payments, wealth management, lending, and insurance services, as well as a range of other fintech offerings such as MYbank and Ant Fortune. Alibaba owns a 33% stake|
|Retail and Other Services|[Ele.Me](http://Ele.Me)|Food delivery service operating in China|
|Retail and Other Services|Freshippo (Hema)|Online-to-offline grocery retail chain offering fresh food and home delivery|
|Retail and Other Services|DingTalk|Business communication and collaboration platform|
|Retail and Other Services|Alibaba Health|Health service platform providing digital healthcare and e-pharmacy solutions​. Alibaba owns a 66% stake.|

It's a ridiculously large conglomerate of mostly loss-leading industries.

The primary drivers of income are the E-Commerce, Cloud, and Logistics segments, which subsidize the high growth subsidiaries.

I'm not going to dive into the business qualitatively, although there's plenty of qualitative reasons to be bullish on China at this point:

1. [PCAOB has full access to the accounting for Alibaba](https://pcaobus.org/news-events/news-releases/news-release-detail/pcaob-secures-complete-access-to-inspect-investigate-chinese-firms-for-first-time-in-history#:~:text=Public%20Company%20Accounting%20Oversight%20Board,time%20in%20history%2C%20in%202022); PwC (Big 4) is Alibaba's auditor
2. [Tech Crackdown has essentially been over for a year.](https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3227753/timeline-chinas-32-month-big-tech-crackdown-killed-worlds-largest-ipo-and-wiped-out-trillions-value)
3. [Stock recently connected to the Chinese exchanges, allowing Chinese citizens to purchase the stock](https://www.alibabagroup.com/en-US/document-1769951994501398528) (it has never dipped below the price of $83/share, where it traded on September 9 prior to this inclusion. Chinese owners have only ever seen green)
4. [Alibaba's Qwen AI is topping the charts in model ranking.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibabas-large-language-model-tops-093000912.html) (Just don't ask it about Tiannanmen Square)
5. [China is gearing up a massive stimulus plan.](https://in.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/this-is-when-china-is-likely-to-present-new-significant-fiscal-stimulus-plan-db-4552712)

These are all certainly catalysts, but I think the fundamental analysis is far more interesting.

Based on their trailing 12 month earnings and current balance sheet, at 200B Market Cap, Alibaba trades on these multiples:

|Multiple|BABA|S&P500|S&P 500 Premium (Discount)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P/S|1.5|3.1|106%|
|P/E|17.7|29.7|67%|
|Operating Margin|15%|12%|(25%)|
|P/OI (Operating Income)|10|25.8|158%|
|Forward P/E|10|24|140%|
|P/B|1.55|5|223%|
|P/FCF|11|24.3|121%|
|EV/EBITDA|8.8|17.5|99%|
|PEG Ratio (Assuming 5% Growth)|3.5|6|71%|

Generic fundamental ratios look beautiful compared to the S&P 500 for BABA, but that's just the start.

Alibaba's net book value is highly liquid, with significant portions of its long term assets stored in equity investments. Realistically, Alibaba is both a China ETF with its equity holdings, and a core business.

Thus, subtracting book value from the market cap and using operating income gives us a better picture of the market's valuation of Alibaba's earnings (which excludes gains/losses from interest+investments)

|Metric|BABA|SP500|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Market Cap|200B|\~48T|
|P/B Ratio|1.5|5|
|Market Cap - Book  Value|67B|\~38T|
|Operating Income|20B|\~1.86T|
|Book Value Adj. Market Cap / Operating Income|3.35|\~20.4|

Just, wow. When you subtract Alibaba's net book value and place a multiple on the operating income alone, Alibaba trades at 3.35x income, as opposed to the SP500 index 20.4. That's a 508% premium for the SP500.

By the above metrics, Alibaba trades at a 50-75% discount to intrinsic value. Based on the current market cap, that's around 400-600B of intrinsic value.

**But wait! CHINA BAD!**

Absolutely, China Bad. So, let's caveat this with some data.

According to Polymarket, the highest yearly odds of China invading Taiwan is around \~20%.

Let's be as conservative as possible. Let's use Polymarket's highest yearly odds of China invading Taiwan as the odds of Alibaba stock going to Zero. Assuming Alibaba stock goes to Zero in this circumstance, let's see what the current market cap of Alibaba should be, adjusting for the risk, and using my bear case low end 400B intrinsic value.

|Alibaba Intrinsic Value|Chance of Happening|
|:-|:-|
|400B|80%|
|0 (War with China)|20%|

We take the calculated intrinsic value example (400B), multiplied by the chance of not going to zero (80%), and end up with 320B market cap, adjusted for the China Bad risk. That's **60% upside** from here.

In the bull case intrinsic value of 600B, multiplied by 80%, we end up with 480B market cap, adjusted for the China Bad risk. That's **140% upside** from here.

TL;DR: No matter how you slice it, even if you take the most conservative valuation metrics for Alibaba and pair them with the most bearish estimates of chance of war with China, Alibaba is still severely undervalued. Even a China bear could justify owning Alibaba at these prices.

wallstreetbets,Bigbear.ai is primed and ready for take-off,"# TL;DR:

BigBear.ai is flying under the radar but has massive potential. This is your chance to grab a future AI juggernaut while it's still cheap. There is a perfect storm of catalysts brewing (government contracts, strategic market positioning, and booming AI demand) - think Palantir but still in its early innings.

**What is it?**

Bigbear is an AI-powered decision-making and analytics platform with a strong focus on government contracts, particularly with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and intelligence agencies. Their software helps organizations predict, visualize, and act on complex data to drive better outcomes.

**Why has it been overlooked?**

1. Tiny market cap of around $550m.
2. Low institutional ownership of less than 10% - mostly VC and Retail (although this has been growing over the last few months).
3. Went public via SPAC so the share price dropped massively initially.

**What it has going for it**

1. Secured a 5-year $165m USD contract from the US Army in October - clearly working closely with government agencies.
2. 2024 Q3 22.1% revenue increase to $41.5m and an improved gross margin of 25.9%, despite a net loss of $12.2m.
3. It's cheap af - expecting FY24 revenue of up to $180m at just $550m market cap. Granted it is loss-making currently but so is RKLB, ACHR, etc..
4. Rated as a Strong Buy from Wall Street analysts.
5. Has diverse revenue streams in healthcare and warehousing, increasing addressable market (already have contracts with Amazon).
6. $437m backlog as of latest earning call.
7. Acquired Pangiam in 2023, a leader in facial recognition tech (CEO was former Director of Homeland Security).
8. The share price has been steadily rising over the past few months, but has yet to explode.

**Catalysts going forward**

Here we get a bit theoretical but I believe there is huge upside here for a few reasons:

1. Trump in office - more spending on defence and domestic security budgets (facial recognition is great for finding illegal immigrants hmmm).
2. It comes across as massively undervalued given it's current revenue and growth potential - trading at just over 3x forward revenue vs Palantir at 45x forward revenue.
3. Institutional ownership is rising fast - smart money is catching on for good reason.
4. Trend-wise, this stock fits the profile of something that will absolutely skyrocket on any positive news. AI deeptech, DoD contracts, growing revenue, and hugely overlooked.
5. It currently has 80 open positions on linkedin and with around 500 employees, this suggests they are investing hard for growth.

Basically, this is your chance to get in early on the next PLTR.

wallstreetbets,NovoCure's Tumor-Treating Electric Fields Shows Promise In Pancreatic Cancer Patients,"On Monday, NovoCure Ltd (NASDAQ:NVCR) and Zai Lab Limited (NASDAQ:ZLAB) revealed topline data from the Phase 3 PANOVA-3 trial of Tumor-Treating Fields (TTFields) therapy concomitantly with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel as a first-line treatment for unresectable, locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma.



The pivotal trial met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in median overall survival (mOS) versus control.



Also Read: FDA Approves NovoCure's Portable Device Producing Tumor-Treating Electric Fields For Previously Treated Lung Cancer Patients



In the intent-to-treat population, patients treated with TTFields therapy concomitant with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel had an mOS of 16.20 months compared to 14.16 months in patients treated with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel alone, a statistically significant 2.0-month improvement (hazard ratio=0.819; *P*=0.039) (N=571).



The survival rate benefit for patients treated with TTFields therapy increased over time, with a 13% improvement in the overall survival rate at 12 months and a 33% improvement in survival rate at 24 months.



TTFields therapy was well-tolerated, and safety was consistent with prior clinical studies. Novocure plans to file for regulatory approval in the U.S., EU, Japan and other key markets. Zai Lab plans to file for regulatory approval in China.



Novocure continues to follow patients in its Phase 2 PANOVA-4 trial, which is exploring the use of TTFields therapy together with atezolizumab, gemcitabine, and nab-paclitaxel for the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer. PANOVA-4 has completed enrollment, and data are anticipated in 2026.

wallstreetbets,SP500 Historical PE Ratio indicates market correction?,"I've been looking into the historical PE ratio of the SP500, to get an overall indication of how the market was during each year and how it faired leading up to a crash. 

From the 50s up until the 90s the SP500 PE ratio was fluctuating between 10-20. Before the dotcom bubble bursting the PE ratio was almost 30 (and then it went up not because the prices went up, but because the earnings went down due to the bubble bursting).

Same thing before the 2008 crash, Lehman Brothers went bankrupt in Sep 2008 and the PE ratio was trending around 28 points before that. Then the PE ratio was corrected and until 2016 it was below 20 points again.

Finally we can see that in the last 5 years the PE ratio has been inflated and trends between 20 - 25 points, except for 2020 where earnings went down so it went to 30. 

Currently we are at 27 points and are approaching 30 without having a major event to cause earnings to drop which means prices are super inflated. Someone may just say that things in the market have changed meme stocks etc. but the basics always remain the same. 

I believe we can't reach PE ratio of 30 and above without having a big correction in the next 1-2 years, even if people say that bull markets last >5 years",1,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h5jece/sp500_historical_pe_ratio_indicates_market/,ive looking historical pe ratio sp get overall indication market year faired leading crash sp pe ratio fluctuating dotcom bubble bursting pe ratio almost went price went earnings went due bubble bursting thing crash lehman brother went bankrupt sep pe ratio trending around point pe ratio corrected point finally see last year pe ratio inflated trend point except earnings went went currently point approaching without major event cause earnings drop mean price super inflated someone may say thing market changed meme stock etc basic always remain believe cant reach pe ratio without big correction next year even people say bull market last year,-0.0029761904761904773,Negative

wallstreetbets,High Yield REIT - Am I missing something?,"Hey fellow gamblers,

Not your typical wallstreetbets post I guess, but wanted to have your opinion on something I stumbled upon recently

The play in question is Allied Properties Real Estate Investment Trust ([AP.UN](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/AP-UN.TO/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGgYU1T7a0d1Kv9Wnlqx__LlmiY5Y-cLNSWNsuDYrD1EpVvo5gUJ9DjwprxeSfzTQ3g6YJVQZZUib2BvYJiP5SAOsGU_jHHATSqee9bp3_Ul-sHOOaNMwtto2KC14pOzEbeqfr3GIh4HTBa3flt8plSdS5fnintSGr0QKbqa9fAB)), which you can buy in Canada on Wealthsimple

What it is : Its an investment trust that owns, manages and develops commercial offices in key Canadian Cities.

Why I think its interesting : I thinks it's been oversold on the long term since people have been moving out of offices since COVID. However, I don't think commercial offices will cease to exist, and I think people will continue going back to the office. WFH is something that won't be as prevalent in 2-3 years as it is now, and certainly not as much as during COVID

However, the main reason I think it's interesting is because right now, it offers a staggering 10.71% dividend. Just for that, if the price remains relatively stable, is a super solid return.

Is there something I am missing? Obviously this post is short, but in my mind getting 10.71% dividend + potential upside on a real estate play is a no brainer right? There is also the very real possibility that there is something I don't understand here and there is a downside I'm missing, idk

wallstreetbets,🚨Bag-holder DD alert: TWLO ALL IN with nvda sprinkles 🚨,"Maybe there is a bag-holder bug going around... I hope my case isn't too bad. 

Tldr:
I'm all in TWLO with nvda sprinkles because Twilio is an ""AI pick and shovel"" play that is being heavily slept on lol. AI is going to the moon. TWLO is also trading at a significant discount relative to its SaaS peers. 

Just look at its weekly chart. Durrrr. 

Also, I don't think I have to say anything about NVDA besides ""buy the dip.""

Real TLDR at very bottom if you don't wanna read. 




Why am I being regarded?


1. I've been inspired by people like ElonIloveyou or whatever that guy's name is, and hopefully, if I hop on the wave quick enough, I can ride it to Valhalla :) 


2. TWLO is SO cheap right now

Although it fell fantastically... what goes down must always go up?

- Current Price-to-Sales (P/S): 2.6x

This is drastically lower than SaaS peers like Snowflake (25x) or ServiceNow (14x). For context, Twilio’s P/S ratio peaked at 20x plus during its high-growth phase in 2021.

- Enterprise Value (EV) to Revenue: 3.8x 

This is also much lower than peers (Smartsheet at 5.6-5.7x, ServiceNow at 12.5-13.8x, ZoomInfo at 7.7x).


3. Although they aren't profitable (who tf is and who cares), their revenue growth is strong and growing and their & margins are healthy.

- Revenue (TTM): $4.07 billion (a solid 10% YoY growth in a tough macro environment)

- Gross margins are stabilizing at 50%

- Cash Balance: $3.8 billion

TWLO has also maintained very low debt compared to peers


4. TWLO has many tailwinds

- Twilio’s recent initiatives include embedding generative AI and predictive analytics into its platforms. TWLO's most recent guidance signaled this advancement to be a significant revenue driver long term.

- Twilio has implemented significant cost-cutting measures and achieved $150 million in annualized savings in Q3 - by focusing on core high-margin products while exiting non-core businesses (Prolly some more tech layoffs around the corner across the board).

- Valuable collabs with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Salesforce enhance Twilio’s market reach.

- The global CPaaS (Communications Platform as a Service) market is expected to grow from $12 billion in 2023 to $35 billion by 2030, representing a CAGR of ~16%. Twilio dominates this space.

- HEAVY INSTITUTIONAL ACCUMULATION HAS OCCURRED RECENTLY. Vanguard and BlackRock have increased their stakes. The big fish are confident in the TWLO turn aruond story.


5. The technical ANALysis says calls, I think.  

- TWLO has broken above its 200-day moving average

- Key support levels: $102, $98.50, $92.

- Resistance levels: $110, $115, and $120.

- High open interest in near-term $110 and $115 calls, super DUPER low IV... maybe for a reason, but idk.


TLDR:
TWLO Is Primed for Upside because:

- Twilio is heavily discounted on all valuation metrics, providing a high margin of safety.

- AI-driven products and cost optimizations are setting the stage for sustained margin growth.

- Technical and options data suggest growing institutional and retail interest.

wallstreetbets,The defense Sector - Can those Earnings be sustained in peace times.,"Lets discuss the sector.

T hasn't made it to the white house yet and he's already cleaning house and arranging furniture, meeting with heads of state as if he's really running things. He's lucky Elon is right there next to him doing the heavy lifting to make things more - efficient.

It got me wondering about the defense sector. The pentagon has failed every audit for the last several years which leads me to believe all these defense contractors are getting kick backs off the books but also their contracts might be over inflated and they taking advantage of Uncle Sam's check book because he doesn't really know what hes signing off on.

Its possible the Dept of Justice might sue them to pay back their, corrupt pricing over the years.

The other factor is Jan 20th inauguration day. Trump clearly said he's not paying a dollar more to Ukraine, so that means billions of dollars is no longer going to flow to the bottom line. Hezbollah and Israel signed a deal. So things are staring to look more peaceful. Zelensky said he might be willing to make concessions on land to make peace.

So the question is, are defense contractors overvalued?

I just don't think they'll be able to sustain earnings like the last two years.

wallstreetbets,"All In on SMCI: $6,000,000 Bet Across Interactive Brokers and My Swiss Bank – Am I Crazy or a Genius?","**In-Depth Investigation of Supermicro (SMCI): Financial Analysis, Future Scenarios, and AI Market Potential**

I’ve spent hours gathering, analyzing, and organizing all the information to present it here for you. I hope it brings clarity to the complexities surrounding Supermicro. As always, everything here represents my personal opinion and is not financial advice or a recommendation.

# Quick Overview

wallstreetbets,Finally Hit $100k in Robinhood After Years of Grind,"First post ever on Reddit albeit a long one so buckle up fellow degens!
Been lurking for 6 years, finally made a new Reddit account to share this milestone. Started this journey back in 2017 in Robinhood, rode the highs and lows, and at one point even saw my portfolio drop to just ~$1K back in July 2022 (see screenshot #2) . But here we are in 2024, looking at ~$110k and up $47k (~76%) all-time! (Still quite can’t beat the benchmark yet; SPY’s got me outpaced in the long term 🥲)

The Ups and Downs

Looking back, it’s been one heck of a rollercoaster. As you can see in my all-time chart, there were some major dips along the way. The journey wasn’t linear; there were times when I felt like the portfolio was just bleeding out, but I stuck with it, made some strategic moves, and kept adding funds whenever possible. 

After starting with the modest account balance of about roughly 18k back in Q4 2017, I steadily added funds to my portfolio over time, especially after seeing triple digit returns in NVDA, SQ and double digit gains in bunch of blue chip stocks; held some Chinese stocks like Luckin Coffee (before it got delisted from NASDAQ) . Got the account to a decent level.
Then went completely ‘regard’ and got into options 😅. Did well initially then hit the rock bottom reaching as low as $998 (see aforementioned screenshot #2). Added about 9-12k over next few months (see screenshot #3) to be able to trade again. No options but used margin money to almost double my account first. Then, as the bull market kicked in after bottoming out in October 2023, the account continued to rise. Later, I employed slightly more aggressive options strategies to reach my current position.

Key Moves 
The past 18 months have been all about- researching a shit ton (more!) and making mostly informed decisions mixing with some gut feeling, using Reddit (of course), stocktwits, yahoo finance, various research firms, reports, interviews, Fidelity, CNBC, etc

Current Portfolio includes: 
•	PLTR, bunch of Semi stocks including NVDA, TSM.
•	Blue Chips (duh!) 
•	Growth stocks like SOFI, SQ, 
 •	ETFs and a few dividend/yield stocks like QQQ, IJH, XLE, JPEQ, etc. 
•	Credit Put Spreads, LEAPS, CSPs, and CCs
	•	PLTR and semi stocks, plus bluechi
Missed out on a 10x gain on NVDA (sold too early); funny enough never went long on TSLA or got into some of the group’s fav stonks from back in 2020-21 (you know which ones 💪🏽), but holding PLTR since 2020 has been solid.
I also hold stuff long term on other platforms- Fidelity and Webull including most of my PLTR shares. Can’t go full degen and YOLO everything just on Robinhood alone; you gotta diversify 😭

wallstreetbets,Who Shorted Regional Banks Due to CRE Exposure? How Did It Work Out & Outlook for 2025?,"Who was shorting regional banks based on their exposure to commercial real estate (CRE) risk. With all the talk about the potential fallout from the CRE sector over the past few years, I’m curious to know who took the plunge and shorted these banks earlier in 2023 or 2024?

Did it work as expected? Any surprises, like a stronger-than-anticipated rebound in bank performance, or did CRE exposure finally start to eat away at their balance sheets?

What’s the outlook on this trade? Do you think the worst of the CRE fallout is yet to come, or is the market pricing in the potential for a prolonged slump? Will regional banks be in for more pain, or do we start seeing a normalization as the economy adjusts?",35,66,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h3lkjx/who_shorted_regional_banks_due_to_cre_exposure/,shorting regional bank based exposure commercial real estate cre risk talk potential fallout cre sector past year im curious know took plunge shorted bank earlier work expected surprise like strongerthananticipated rebound bank performance cre exposure finally start eat away balance sheet whats outlook trade think worst cre fallout yet come market pricing potential prolonged slump regional bank pain start seeing normalization economy adjusts,-0.125,Negative
wallstreetbets,MSTR vs BTC (etf) vs BTC,"Late to the game but looking at adding some bitcoin.
Any thoughts on these options?

MSTR = if course higher valuation than their BTC holdings and is sort if a 3-4x proxy. But volatility could translate to higher growth than BTC alone. Plus, selling covered calls has some really juicy premiums.

BTC = actually buying bitcoin. Most direct. But it bugs me crypto is treated so oddly. Asked if you own crypto on taxes and some banks. Prefer to avoid this stuff.

BTC (etf) = seems the most straightforward way to get into Bitcoin. Fee is 0.15% which isn’t crazy high.

wallstreetbets,MRNA bounce incoming ,"Good evening degens.  Last weekend I made a DD about NVDA breaking its upward trend line this week and selling off.  The post was downvoted to hell and I was called regarded.  Although I am highly regarded, that call out was not, and I was right.  I have another play for next week I’d like to share.  

We all remember Moderna(MRNA) from the Covid era.  The stock ran from $30 to $500 in about a year and a half.  It has since been absolutely butt fucked into oblivion.  Covid shot revenue is drying up and they are scrambling to find other sources.   On top of that, RFK plans to basically put them out of business(if he gets approved, which I don’t think he will).   Regardless, this play is not long term, although I do think this is a really good buy spot if you are hopeful about their long term business(which you should be).  Also, the stock got an upgrade from hold to buy by HSBC with a $58 price target, and there were multiple articles pondering whether the stock was sold off enough to warrant buying here, all of which advise buying.  These articles don’t mean shit, but it’s positive sentiment.  

Again,  THIS IS A SHORT TERM PLAY.  LIKE ONE WEEK, MAYBE TWO.  Now for the charts.   You can see on the daily it’s been in a solid downtrend since it had a little run in May.  But I think that is coming to end this week, at least temporarily.  The price double bottomed nicely at $35 last week.  I’ve been looking for this level because this was resistance/support 4 different times back in 2020(long time ago, but in my brain it matters).  I think this will be a hard number to crack, especially since selling seems to be exhausted.  Those selling at this level are very likely selling for a large loss, and I think those that want to jump ship have already done so.  

On the daily, we are right on the trend line and the stock is at support.  This is the EXACT same setup as NVDA last week, except NVDA was breaking down after a big run, and I expect MRNA to break up after a massive ass whooping.  You can also see that volume has been much higher the past 2 weeks.  I believe smart, wealthy buyers are stepping here and loading the boat, and some are buying short term call options for next week, which brings me to the put call ratio.  

The first graph is the put call ratio for this past week.  You can see a slightly bullish lean with a ratio of 0.5, but there was a fair amount of put open interest at the 42,41, and 30 strikes, all of which expired worthless.  The next graph is the open interest for next week.  A ratio of 0.24 is extremely bullish, with 31,634 active call options and 7,536 puts.   You do not have that kind of ratio on a stock that’s been sinking like the Titanic unless smart money thinks that the selling is done and the stock is due for a reversal.   I was on the fence about this play until I looked at the option chain. 

I’m currently in the 12/6 45 calls.  I’m hoping to see a clear break of the trend line monday or Tuesday on strong volume, and would love to see a test of $50 at some point.  If i see a clear rejection at the trend line and it looks like it’ll test $35 again, I’ll stop out.  I’m pretty confident in this one tho, about as confident as I was in the NVDA play.  

Best of luck if tailing, and this is not financial advice.

wallstreetbets,"Why I think $RDDT will surpass $1k a share easily - Search, eComm, and ads = $$$$","Hear me out. I'm not coming at this from a technical or fundamental perspective, so there are some things to explain for those that don't understand. But also want to hear others perspectives, even the bears (respectfully if possible hah)

I'm not a trader by any means. I'm in Reddit because my background is giving me some new perspective on the potential. 

My background is in SEO (search engine optimization). I know the search engines. I know how websites are monetized. I've seen hundreds of millions of dollars pass through the hands of clients, bloggers, ecom stores I've owned, CPA offers and leveraging social media, etc etc 

There's an endless supply of money on the web via ad revenue, product referrals, and money to be had without actually selling a thing. If you don't understand how ad revenue is generated on the web, it similar to traditional advertising models. Traditionally you would charge by CPM (cost per 1000 impressions). An impression is simply someone seeing an ad. For example if a billboard company sells you an ad space it's based on the amount of people that travel down the freeway. So if the freeway has 10k traffic everyday thats 10k impressions a day and the advertising company sets a price for the CPM. 

With the web you have more avenues to monetize. But the majority of monetizing with ads is via CPCs and CPM. CPC = cost per click. We can get into marketing funnels and offers and yada yada but thats not how a company like Reddit is going to monetize. I've seen little dinky websites that leverage ranking web pages for keywords in Google make big $$. One example is a DUI attorney I worked with in Phoenix who had a blog. So you understand how blog monetization works just go to any blog and look at their ads on the page, and possible affiliate links inside of the content. Anyhow, for the DUI attorney his ads in the side bar of his blog were earning him on average $40 per click. Everytime someone clicked an ad on his page he made approx $40. ""dui attorney phoenix"" currently has a range of $30 - $225 per click and get and avg of $82 per click as one example. His adsense account made $10k a month roughly on a blog that was getting about $20k in monthly traffic. Reddit has 1.2 billion in unique organic visitors every month. And growing

Reddit is in it's infancy when it comes to monetizing their traffic and really leverging their ads such as a company like Facebook/Meta.

However, it has more organic traffic than Amazon. Last I checked Reddit was fluctuating between #5 and #7 in terms of sites with the largest traffic. 

Amazon IPO'd at $18 a share. They adjusted shares 480x (not sure if that number is 100% correct, but I think it is) which means the current share price since IPO without splits is about $99k per share. 

If Reddit closes the gaps in 3 areas...

Dials in their ad monetization  
Launches a Marketplace  
Capitalizes on local search traffic

It's my opinion this could easily be $1000+ a share. Market cap is a measly 25 bil. 

NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE this is only my outlook based on the possibility with leveraging search traffic and monetizing it, the possibility that being the 5th largest traffic driver on the web brings, and why I'm invested.

wallstreetbets,"Quadrupled Down. Stock still at Lows, still Sub-$2B Market Cap, $600M FCF, $4B in Assets, and Over 30% Short - Still Absurd.","My post about Kohl’s sparked a ton of discussion, so I wanted to address some of the recurring comments and clarify a few things. Here's the original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h0dgpq/stock\_is\_trading\_at\_alltime\_lows\_with\_a\_sub2b/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h0dgpq/stock_is_trading_at_alltime_lows_with_a_sub2b/)

1. I quadrupled Down: Throughout the day, I added to my position every time I read a bearish comment that ignored the three core pillars of the thesis: Kohl’s cash position, net asset value, and dividend yield. **As of now, I’m $130K deep into this trade.**
2. This is a pure value play: Kohl’s isn’t suddenly going to become the next Amazon, and that’s fine. The thesis isn’t predicated on some retail turnaround miracle. This is a simple value play: I’m buying $2 worth of assets for $1. Kohl’s NAV dwarfs its market cap, and it throws off real cash flow.
3. New CEO: the markets reaction (and many of the comments) was that the new CEO is a bearish signal, makes no sense. The new CEO is the guy who turned around Michaels in 2020 and SOLD IT TO APOLLO FOR $3B. The worst thing about Kohls management thus far has been their desire to not liquidate its most valuable asset (real estate) and instead simply return cash flow to shareholders. I’m not complaining about the latter, but the former would’ve been an $8B sale in 2022 if management had agreed to it. Currently trading for $1.5B with the same real estate assets on the book.
4. Bag Holding vs. Conviction: There are times when you feel like a bag holder and hopium is your drug. And then there are times where when it goes down you calmly buy more. And in the latter times, you want to bring everyone along for the ride. Getting rich alone isn’t meaningful.

wallstreetbets,Bitcoin Short Thesis,"https://preview.redd.it/0iedxgoitr3e1.png?width=1770&format=png&auto=webp&s=11aaa42bce9b7b9fe5cf4a3944a7235a2f4ef51d

Michael Saylor went on CNBC this week and said bitcoin has returned 60% annually since inception and he predicts a more modest 29% annual return over the next 10 years. He neglected to mention that less than 1% of all bitcoin volume was before 2018. This would be like saying Microsoft returned 327,401% since IPO so we expect a modest 100,000% return over the next 30 years.

It is easily verifiable that bitcoin tracks almost identical to the 2x nasdaq. In 2022 bitcoin fell 75% in 10 months, coincidentally the same time we had the highest CPI prints in 40 years. No store of value or inflation hedge can fall 75% in 10 months by definition. Just this past week bitcoin fell 10% in two days!

In 2017 I saw someone on CNBC saying that with adoption the volatility will go down. It is seven years later and volume adjusted volatility is significantly higher than then. Also, this is just something people say with no evidence. Just an assumption.

Remember when everyone was waiting for bitcoin ETFs to be announced and someone hacked the SEC's twitter account and sent the price of BTC up 5% instantly? What store of value can be this manipulated over a tweet? Imagine if someone hacked trumps truth social account, or a government page, or any of the other government officials around the world that are involved in bitcoin. There are no circuit breakers on crypto exchanges and there are insane amounts of leverage in bitcoin.

There is nothing stopping any bad actor or state from manipulating the bitcoin market. Now that we are flooded with derivatives to short bitcoin, they can flood the market with bitcoin while shorting.

Why would the United States sell US dollars to buy bitcoin? Why would it sell gold and not give that money to the taxpayers or convert it to USD? What does it say about our confidence in our own currency if we decided to sell USD for bitcoin? It is frankly absurd, dangerous, and a waste of taxpayers money to pump up the bags of current bitcoin holders. They should instead sell their bitcoin and give that money back to its people that it serves. 30% of all bitcoin exists within the borders of China and Russia. We would hurt their holdings, instead of propping up their bags with our tax dollars.

If one hacked twitter tweet can move bitcoin in a 10% swing, what is bitcoin really?

I can absolutely lose on this trade. It is impossible to time bubbles. I do not even believe I have an edge on this trade. But I believe bitcoin is a giant ponzi scheme and I want to take a stab.

wallstreetbets,MicroStrategy in layman's terms,"It's been a while since the days of my regard college finance classes, but here is my understanding of MicroStrategy in layman's terms (kind of). Please correct me if anything is off.

The CEO of MicroStrategy, Michael Saylor, has been saying that Bitcoin is the future because he expects Bitcoin to be an alternative reserve currency that will take up a larger portion of the global reserve currency pool over time, so the value of Bitcoin will inevitably go up over time (whether you agree with this premise is for another day). MSTR has been gradually loading up on Bitcoin in recent years. Given the recent US election result, the incoming administration is signaling a more open and favorable view of crypto adoption (although it's not clear if/how this will happen), especially with the appointment of Elon Musk to a meme government entity named after a meme coin. This led to a huge rally in the crypto market, especially for Bitcoin and subsequently MSTR who has been loading up on Bitcoin for a while now.

Now this is where things get crazy: MSTR is taking advantage of their rise in stock price to go out and ask institutional investors to buy their 0% interest convertible bonds. As of the most recent round, these bonds are structured as 5-year in maturity with 0% interest rate and a convertible price of 130% of current market price. To make the math simple, MSTR is currently trading at around $400 per share, so the bond holders can either convert the bonds into shares at ($400)(130%) = $520 per share in 5 years or get their principal back. Saylor is selling the promise that Bitcoin will go up significantly in the next 5 years (e.g. Bitcoin's 4-year halving cycle), so it's a great bargain for the institutional bond holders because they are essentially giving up the 5-year interest payments in exchange for an embedded call option to buy MSTR at $520/share in 5 years. Ask yourself, how likely that MSTR will only go up by 30% and trade at around $520 in 5 years? This is essentially the selling point that has the new institutional buyers hooked (whether you agree is a different story, but the institutional buyers seem to agree for now). On the MSTR side, Saylor is using the money to acquire additional Bitcoin and continue to hype up the FOMO sentiment around Bitcoin without ever worrying about financing cost in the meantime due to the 0% interest nature of these bonds. This will likely continue to drive Bitcoin and MSTR prices higher and higher for sometime, so this ""free money glitch"" phenomenon can continue to go on for a little while, creating a positive loop for MSTR to continue buying up more Bitcoin. So far this is the surface level explanation for the Bitcoin and MSTR pump as long as institutional investors are still buying into their convertible bonds, but it gets crazier...

You may ask why would anyone, especially big institutional buyers, just not buy Bitcoin or Bitcoin funds directly? The simple answer is, it has something to do with the investment mandate prohibiting the trading of crypto directly since they are deemed as risky assets, so they resort to something like MSTR bond offering as a proxy for Bitcoin exposure because bonds are generally considered safer. This is what Saylor meant by ""we are a Bitcoin treasury company"" during his recent CNBC interview. But that's not the full story... These institutional buyers (think pension funds, insurance liabilities, sovereign wealth funds, etc.) also need to worry about hedging their volatility and limit loss exposure to this risky asset class called Bitcoin. In the equity market, this big IV is directly reflected in the costly option premiums; as vega goes up so do option prices. However, the cost of embedded call option from the convertible bond is materially lower due to the inflexible nature of the convertible bond (e.g. only redeemable in 5 years, interest rate risk, opportunity cost, less liquid bond market, etc.). In other words, the cost of embedded call option through convertible bond offering is only the interest payments lost over the 5-year horizon and nothing more (except MSTR goes completely belly up, which I'll explain why it's unlikely later). However, these institutions can also turn around and sell call options in the open equity market at a premium. This is essentially a replicating portfolio that seeks to exchange the lost interest payments from the 0% bond for the call option premiums at a strike price of $520 in 5 years. Then, there is also the cherry on top with additional arbitrage potential that exploits the inflexibility of the bond market and the more expensive option premiums in the equity market due to high IV. Say it differently, the effective yield on these bonds are most likely higher than selling a vanilla corporate bond that pays the current market yield. This is what Saylor meant by ""the way we make money is we are selling the volatility \[to big institutional bond buyers who are willing to take up the 0% interest for 5 years deal while MSTR pays no interests\] and recycling it back to Bitcoin \[use the bond proceeds to hype up Bitcoin more\].""

Now to address the elephant in the room: what if Bitcoin has a massive correction and MSTR goes belly up? The short answer is, it's not likely and it doesn't really matter. First of all, MSTR is taking advantage of Bitcoin's 4-year halving cycle and structuring its bond maturity around it with the hope of that Bitcoin continues to play out the way MSTR expected so the bond obligations can either convert or roll over, especially now with more players trying to mimic their play and further pumping Bitcoin. In the meantime, they have virtually no interest obligations to worry about on their newly issued 0% convertible bonds for the next 5 years. 5-year is a long time horizon, which means they have plenty of opportunities to offload if they sense that something is going in the wrong direction. Secondly, there were simulations done to show how much Bitcoin needs to drop for MSTR to force liquidate Bitcoin to pay its debt obligation. The consensus price range is around $15k to $30k (feel free to challenge this claim if you think otherwise), which is not very likely given Bitcoin's current trading price of around $100k; Bitcoin price needs to drop significantly for this scenario to play. And hopefully they would have started to offload sooner before it drops to that level as explained by the first reason above. Lastly, the institutions have already hedged their losses, so it doesn't matter. They are effectively selling a fancy put option where the most they can lose is missing out on the 5-year interest payments if MSTR goes downhill in 5 years (they would just get the principal back and they still have priority claim over stockholders if things go really wrong). That said, the more likely playoff is that the institutional investors buy the convertible bonds by forgoing 5 years of interest payments, sell calls in the equity market at a big premium due to high IV, convert the bonds into shares in 5 years, and give the shares to call holders while taking a fat profit in the process (i.e. right end of short put payoff graph plus maybe a little bit more). Not to mention that these are some of the biggest and most sophisticated players in the financial market, so they have every interest to ensure that MSTR doesn't go completely belly up. Therefore, MSTR is likely here to stay for now as it continues to attract more institutional attention.

In summary:

\- MSTR can go up or down or sideway and it doesn't matter because institutions always find ways to skim from regard retails like you and me

\- If MSTR goes up, your shares will forever get diluted by your fellow regard call holders from bond converts while institutions get a fat check playing middleman

\- If MSTR goes belly up, institutions will get their money back first while you take another load behind Wendy's dumpster

\- If MSTR trades sideway, you get theta ganged

wallstreetbets," NVDA's stock is down 10% in a week, is he still worth following?","NVIDIA reported impressive earnings, with quarterly revenues reaching $35 billion, up 94% year-over-year, with even stronger growth in the data center business, up 112%. Net income doubled to $20 billion and the company showed a strong outlook for future quarters, slightly exceeding market expectations. However, while growth remains impressive, fourth-quarter expected revenue of $37.5 billion is growing at a slower pace, well below the strong growth seen in previous quarters (122%, 262%, 265%). Since then, market concerns about a possible trade war in China have intensified, causing shares to fall

Despite the slowing growth concerns, analysts believe NVIDIA's fundamentals remain solid. The company's dominant position in artificial intelligence and its production capacity constraints mean that it still has plenty of room to grow its revenues. The stock is expected to reach $170 in the next three months. However, while NVIDIA still has investment potential, a number of other AI stocks could offer higher returns in the shorter term and are worth keeping an eye on. If you're looking for an AI stock that's more promising than NVDA but trades for less than 5x its earnings we can talk to each other

wallstreetbets,Crazy yield farming…,"
The new administration seems to be very pro crypto, and with the next bull run is seemingly underway. Why not yolo into that?

Taking into account the crazy high dividends on CONY and MSTY. Why is it a bad thing to be long with a large play into both? 

For example, purchase a 1k shares of each… the monthly dividend would be exceptional. 

To protect against loss, buy long dated put contracts for the same funds. 

Reap the dividends while being protected on the initial investment via the put contracts. One months dividend will cover nearly all the premium of the contracts. 

Am I totally regarded or does this make sense?

wallstreetbets,Where are future returns even supposed to come from? ,"Happy thanksgiving to all of you, I hope you are able to spend time with your loved ones. Just some discussion points about overall valuations in the equity markets. 

This is something that I have wondered for a while. Almost every asset under the sun has skyrocketed, and obviously people are planning to get a return on their investment, so let's discuss how this is even supposed to happen at this point. 

First, there's the low hanging fruit in terms of arguments supporting that we are in a wildly overvalued equity bubble. Dogecoin is worth more than Nintendo. Palantir trades at nearly 60x revenue and made a nanopenny of earnings on a market cap that is nearing ASML's. Tesla is worth $1.1T and thus somehow larger than berkshire. Carvana. I'm not even going to talk about bitcoin. These are prime examples of rampant market speculation and I believe nobody who has their two brain halves connected would argue that these are not cult assets that are disconnected from reality. 

But digging a bit deeper, the bubble doesn't remotely seem to be isolated to certain sectors. Apple is a lick away from 40x earnings. Walmart trades at nearly 40x earnings. Costco somehow manages to sell at nearly 60x earnings. Eli Lilly commands an 85x multiple as an entry price. ServiceNow trades at nearly 175x GAAP eps. These aren't 2021-style ARKK stocks but the largest companies in the world. 

Nvidia is probably the greatest financial success story of all time but they too quickly need to find another $80 billion of annual earnings somewhere otherwise they will also eventually implode like a neutron star. And all of that is happening while the 10-year yields close to 4.5%!

I mean, I like walmart and I like costco. They are good companies. It's a sticky business and they have carved out a nice piece of the U.S. economy for themselves. But Walmart does nearly $700b in revenue and has 3% operating margins. The current EPS yield is barely 2.5%. What is supposed to happen here? Earnings isnt expected to skyrocket and that multiple is so stretched that even 10% yearly EPS growth may leave bulls without a return until 2034. Never, even in my fever dreams, would I have believed that a company like costco would command a 60x premium. 

It seems to me that nearly any asset imaginable is wildly overbought and that people are just pouring they paychecks into the stock market because it has a history of only going up and to the right. But multiples are arguably way ahead of themselves. Current CAPE-ratio has only been higher during two times in history: 1929 and the dotcom bubble. This is kind of a cliché but at the same time, owning these stocks nets you nearly nothing. So what's the game here? Are people betting that Costco will trade at 80x earnings next year? 

Everything I know as a value investor tells me that this must end and that it is time to hedge. But at the same time, anyone who has shorted this ridiculous market has been ground to a pulp by the onslaught of endless liquidity that's pouring into the market. 

So what do you guys think? Are the U.S. stock markets about to pull a Nikkei and leave us all grinding our teeth until 2040 before a new high will be set? Hope that turkey tastes well by the way.

wallstreetbets,$HIMS is about to get absolutely wrecked. ,"Meta is about to announce a major change to their advertising policies that will decimate HIMS ability to efficiently acquire customers via their most critical channel: Facebook and Instagram Ads.

This is because Meta will be restricting brands like HIMS from using purchase-optimized campaigns, which many are speculating is due to legal liabilities associated with HIPAA violations and the use of the Facebook Pixel, the essential ingredient to running the most profitable type of Facebook ad campaigns.

How do I know this? I run an agency that specializes in Facebook ads and I can tell you this is every FB/IG advertiser's worst nightmare. I would be in a total panic if this was happening to me.

I’ve tested running ads without purchase optimization over many years and I can tell you they are absolute dog shit for getting an ROI. Full stop.

Back to HIMS.

They are especially fucked because:

1. They have a client/patient portal that is subject to strict HIPAA requirements. These advertisers are being specifically targeted by this change.
2. They are overly reliant on Meta ads like many direct to consumer brands. Losing the ability to leverage the best optimization settings will be catastrophic to HIMS customer acquisition cost on day 1.

These changes are going into effect on January 1 and Meta is expected to officially announce it on December 5th. 

If HIMS doesn’t immediately take a hit upon this being announced then I see their Q1-Q2 earnings to look like a flatline after what will likely be their biggest Q4 ever.

wallstreetbets,I have reasons to believe that Recursion (RXRX) will became quite popular in the next month.,"I believe that in the future, drugs will be highly customisable based on the patience’s health history. Based on your physiology, syndromes, and genetics, you may receive a drug that is well-suited for you and only you. 

How can you do that? First and foremost, you need data, huge amounts of it. We all know how generative and predictive models had advanced in the last year. It wasn’t in fact, until the launch of AlphaFold (by Google, whose team was recently awarded with the Chemistry Nobel Prize), that AI drug discovery became prominent. This open source model is used for molecular discovery. Again, would be nice if a company could:

1. Generate proprietary synthetic, good quality molecular data using models like AlphaFold.
2. Using this data to train models for drug discovery, reducing pipelines costs and times up to 50%.
3. Eventually, with the possibility of bringing the first AI-aided drug to the market.

First two points have been achieved, and the company is Recursion. We may know them because NVIDIA invested 50m in them. Why then are at ATL? I think the answer is time. We all know there is no room for patience when it comes to money sometimes. Training and bringing such results may take years.

However, I think another catalyst is coming. On 9. December, they will host a seminar for new readouts in one of their most well-known drugs in development, CDK7, for advance solid tumours (an inhibitor, which are currently none approved by the FDA).

Now, I am not saying that they will cure cancer - that’s BS. But over the years converging to novel oncological solutions using AI? This is not the only drug they have (other 9 are in development).

They have more than 60 petabytes of data.
They combined forces with Exscientia recently, forming probably the most important powerhouse of AI-drug research.
They are extremely active in the research field (see their presence in the upcoming NeuRIPS conference) or their new open dataset for Quantum Computing (OpenQDC).

I started investing in IONQ in 2021 for a similar impression. Now I am getting the same vibes with this. I feel that a small catalyst will put this to fly, although the real potencial will come in the next 5-10 years. If they can bring the first AI drug to the market,  this implodes.

wallstreetbets,"Good Buying Opportunity After NVDA Pullback
","First of all, I'd like to wish you all a Happy Thanksgiving, and in the midst of today's market break I'd like to share some of my analysis on NVDA

NVIDIA recently reported strong earnings, but the stock pulled back on profit retrenchment. Nonetheless, I think this may provide a buying opportunity for investors

AI growth logic remains strong

NVIDIA's dominant position in data centers allows it to benefit from the $1 trillion wave of global AI infrastructure investment. Despite increased skepticism about the potential for AI expansion, company management remains confident in the demand for AI chips, with the CFO stating that demand for next-generation Blackwell chips is “phenomenal” and that large customers show no signs of slowing their drive to invest in AI

Short-term challenges and long-term potential

In the short term, NVIDIA may face supply constraints and margin dilution, but these issues are seen as temporary. Although the growth rate is slowing down due to the “law of large numbers”, long-term demand is expected to continue to grow with the advancement of enterprise AI and sovereign AI

Technical trends and investment recommendations

From a technical perspective, NVIDIA is in an overall uptrend and the current pullback has not created a clear bearish reversal. I believe that the volatility in the stock price provides a good opportunity to add to a position on the pullback. NVIDIA's forward-looking PEG ratio is below the industry median, indicating that its valuation remains attractive

While volatility is likely to continue in the short term, NVIDIA's leadership in AI and long-term growth potential make it a noteworthy investment target

wallstreetbets,A Lot of Potential For $ZTO,"Yes, funny lines go *brrrrrrrr*.

Anyways, the YTD pattern thus far for $ZTO seems to indicate that buy/sell volume is cyclical, while maintaining a very nice positive slope for the bottoms. RSI(14) indicates it is oversold right now, and for every time this year that $ZTO has been oversold, the price of the shares will move back up from that point. Conversely, qhen the RSI is overbought, it goes down. The fact that this pattern can be observed is why I have bought options contracts at the strikes I did *($20-$22 strikes-ish, see in 2nd pic)*

$ZTO is a solid Chinese giant with 26 analyst ratings that give it a 92% buy score, with a target price of $21.20/share.

The companies rolls in a profit of $1.2B, with sales of about $5.83B, and has very low to non-existent debt of 0.01 LTDebt/Eq and pays roughly a 5% dividend. It has a nice low, but positive P/E of 13, and EPS has been positive through the year. There isn't much to not like about this stock right now.

If you're feeling frisky, buy some call options like I did, otherwise, this is a company I would buy shares outright for and wait for the next top to sell off at. I'm personally expecting a movement to the target price before January 17th.

wallstreetbets,Thanksgiving is the biggest day of the year for regards to incentivize other regards to do regarded things with their money.,"With this fact known, I think we're about to have a huge pop in all markets starting tomorrow. I need help though putting together what I believe will be the ultimate payday plan if it all goes the way I believe it will.

I believe Bitcoin goes to at least $150,000 a coin this run, and most likely by May of 2025. The play I want to make is calls or longs on MicroStrategy ($MSTR) until the end of April of 2025, and then I want to reverse my position into puts or shorts to ride it all the way down when Bitcoin does its highly predictable cycle nosedive.

At this point, I'm not sure how MicroStrategy will do, because if Bitcoin loses its normal 50 to 80 percent, how does MicroStrategy justify itself until the next cryptocurrency cycle at some point in 2028 or 2029?

They do have 0% interest loans, so maybe nothing significant happens to them, because eventually Bitcoin always goes up and up, so maybe this play can be rinsed and repeated forever.

What do you think, and what plays are you going into tomorrow with?

Of course I am not going to trade off of my feelings, only when confirmation comes but I genuinely cannot shake it.

We are resting just above major support formed over past few months. I expect volume to be low due to thanks giving so may just be overthinking but there is not much buyer interest and much less accumulation occurring, this may change when open comes round.

Does anyone believe we could dump today or am I just being regarded.

NVDA also seems to have very little buyer interest but I don't trade or even watch NVDA. There was a FVG created on the daily which could be why but even then, resting under support with little accumulation concerns me.

wallstreetbets,$OKLO is Undervalued Relative to $SMR,"It’s mind-boggling that Oklo trades at **\~37%** of NuScale’s market cap ($2.6B vs $6.9B). I strongly believe this valuation disparity will eventually correct. For context, if Oklo were valued similarly to NuScale, its share price could exceed **$58/share**.

Oklo is positioned to lead the domestic nuclear sector;

* Capital Efficiency: arguably the healthiest balance sheet amongst SMR projects, having enough cash on hand to fund through their initial builds, with a low burn rate.
* Strong Leadership: executive leadership team with PhDs, Sam Altman as chairman, and a current board member slated to lead the Energy sector (Chris Wright.) Jake and Caroline (founders) are extremely passionate about the technology and opportunity, signaling to investors that they are keeping their equity for the long haul.
* Proven Technology: EBR-II operated through decades of testing between 1964-1994 at INL, clearly demonstrating that the molten sodium fast reactor can operate reliably and efficiently overtime.
* First-mover Advantage: Aurora is on target towards 2027 deployment at INL. Oklo has had the most regulatory engagement relative to other advanced reactor projects and have hired on a lot of former NRC regulatory staff. Also, unlike their competitors, they’ve already secured fuel from the DOE for their first Aurora build.
* Commercialization Model: their ‘owner and operator’ model will allow them to scale rapidly and profitably alongside AI data centers throughout the 2030s. NRC whitepapers suggested that subsequent site reviews will take as little as 7 months, and Oklo will be able to debt finance project builds through future projected cash flows. They currently have 2.1GW in customer commitments, most notably from Equinix and Wyoming hyperscale.
* Alternative Revenue Streams: Oklo has positioned itself to benefit from other revenue sources; uranium recycling to repurpose fuel from nuclear waste reserves, and the manufacturing of radioisotopes through the recently proposed acquisition of Atomic Alchemy.

In contrast, NuScale is in a much worse position with regard to timelines:

* NuScale doesn’t have any construction or operating licenses, they only have a design certification for their 12x50MW plant. In order for their customers to obtain those licenses, it requires a 24-36 month NRC review period that **has not been initiated yet**. This is why NuScale was projecting their first builds in early 2030s, which is years behind Oklo’s 2027 target and that’s probably being optimistic (as you’ll see below).
* The reason why OKLO is so much further ahead is because they are submitting a COLA, which seeks approval for design, construction and operating, only taking them 24 months. Compare this to NuScale, where **every individual customer** needs to create and submit detailed plans, then wait 24-36 months for build and operating licenses.
* It was a strategic choice by NuScale and others to only sell designs and not be an ‘owner and operator’ like Oklo. They would have to commit to the responsibility of building and running the reactors themselves, which does come with additional hurdles and liability, but allows for **much faster** scaling.
* Putting aside those timelines, Nuscale’s 12x50MW plant was found to be **not economically viable**, so they are back to get a standard design approval for their 6x77MW plant. Considering this factor along with the licensing timelines, their 6x77MW will likely take until 2033 for customer deployment.

Looking ahead, there is significant potential for an OpenAl partnership to materialize in the wake of all the demand that we've been seeing. Sam Altman recently visited DC to pitch lawmakers on the need for multiple 5GW data centers and pushed for the NRC to further streamline SMR approvals to meet those needs. If Oklo would be able to supply just a fraction OpenAl's future energy consumption, that would translate to a massive recurring revenue stream. Combine this with the fact that they are entering a more friendly regulatory environment, especially with Chris Wright heading the DOE under the Trump administration.

**TLDR:** $SMR is far behind $OKLO in licensing timelines (by as much as 6+ years) and it does not appear to be reflected in the market. Aside from the obvious timeline advantage, Oklo stands to benefit from their capital efficiency, leadership team, first-mover advantage, commercialization model, and diversified revenue mix.

wallstreetbets,Why NVDA is about to take off after taking a beating (technically speaking),"NVDA has been a kick in the ass lately. I'm holding 500 shares @ $142.25 and a bunch of calls at various dates and prices. 

I identified 3 support levels from June through September, 2 of which have been broken. The next stop is $131-ish IMO. 

Why? This level has been tested twice before and this will be the third time. The other 2 support levels have been tested 0-1 times and we're squashed like bugs. This level has more validity behind it.

In addition, the 9 RSI on the 60min chart (at the time of this writing) reads 22, which implies a stock that got the shit kicked out of it. On the daily, it's a 34. I thought this stock is in an uptrend, wild it got here. And this stock is NVDA, not to be played like a cuck. Real chutzpah it's all the way down here, if you ask me.

I think we will see a serious bounce back to test 150 over 2 weeks, which I base on absolutely nothing. But it's like a rubber band that you stretch so much that it will snap into your eye.

I would not be buying puts at this level, I'd be buying SHARES, or calls, and take a little short term heat for a big payout.

And why did I not wait to buy at this prices instead of buying at $142? 

Bc I'm an idiot and made an impulsive trade. You can't time the top or bottom and I have no doubt it will come back. But how far do I want my ass stretched to get there? 

A question we all must ask ourselves.

Good day to you all

wallstreetbets,Why $SPY is the Real Thanksgiving Turkey 🦃,"Alright degenerates, gather round the table because I’ve cooked up some sweet Thanksgiving DD, and no, it’s not cranberry sauce (but this could be just as saucy). Here’s the deal: Thanksgiving isn’t just about stuffing your face and awkwardly dodging Aunt Karen’s questions about why you’re ""still single""—it’s also PRIME TIME for unsolicited stock and crypto pitches at family dinners. And that, my friends, is why Black Friday is not just for TVs at 80% off, but also for **stupidly green markets.**

Here’s how it works:

1. **Family Financial Influencers™:** Grandpa brings up how he’s *still* holding Exxon since the 80s, your cousin Chad flexes his crypto portfolio (which is 90% down, but whatever), and your tech-savvy niece just learned about AI stocks and is suddenly Jim Cramer. Everyone at the table is buzzing with ""hot picks"" while passing the mashed potatoes. This is not financial advice… but it kinda is.
2. **The FOMO Catalyst:** Uncle Bob hears about ""some stock with a weird ticker"" (it’s ACHR, Bob, get with it) and thinks, “Why the hell am I not in this?” By the time the pumpkin pie rolls around, he’s downloading Robinhood. Multiply Uncle Bobs across America, and boom, retail frenzy ensues Friday morning.
3. **Markets are Closed Thursday:** This is key. People have 24 whole hours to stew in their newfound *knowledge*. By the time the market opens Friday, all that pent-up Thanksgiving YOLO energy explodes into buying pressure. Everyone’s a financial genius after 3 glasses of wine and a turkey coma.
4. **Black Friday Greenery:** You know how everyone shops like maniacs on Black Friday? Stocks are no different. This is the ""stock market doorbuster effect."" Everyone's piling into stocks like they’re $5 air fryers. And best of all, it’s also the gateway to the “Santa Claus rally.” As Christmas shopping kicks off, so might the stock market's annual tradition of going full holiday cheer mode. It’s like the market whispering, “You’ve been good this year, here’s a little green to celebrate.” 🎅📈

# My Prediction for Friday:

* **$SPY** opens green (duh): Like your drunk uncle's karaoke rendition of ""Sweet Caroline,"" it’s inevitable.
* **Tech stocks?** Probably up because Aunt Susan heard about AI once on The Today Show and now thinks it’s the key to immortality (it is).
* **Crypto?** Let’s be real—Cousin Chad is hyping Bitcoin like he’s got Satoshi on speed dial. It’s probably gonna pump harder than Grandma’s blood pressure when she finds out you brought store-bought pie.
* **Random meme stocks?** Oh yeah, because someone’s cousin brought up “that one company with the short interest that shall not be mentioned.”
* **ACHR?** $ACHR will be taking a flight (literally and figuratively) this Friday—WSB's favorite bird is ready to soar, and you degenerates are gonna love it. 🚁💸

**TL;DR:** Thanksgiving isn’t just about turkey—it’s a breeding ground for half-baked stock ideas. When Friday rolls around, we’re gonna see a tsunami of retail money hit the markets. $SPY gonna pop, and we’ll all be riding the gravy train. **To the moon or the Wendy's dumpster, GODSPEED** 🫡

*Disclaimer:* This is absolutely NOT financial advice—just a turkey-fueled theory for entertainment purposes only. If it somehow works, consider sharing some pumpkin pie and maybe a thank-you card. 🚀

wallstreetbets,NVDA is about to take off (technically speaking): why I feel more confident following my previous post ,"Greetings,

I hope everyone is getting ready to talk stocks and politics at the Thanksgiving table because that's what the holiday is all about, amiright?

I for one will be talking about NVDA.

I posted earlier today around 10am-11am EST and said that NVDA was gonna stop sliding at 131-ish, since there is a good support there.

And what happened???? The turkey came home to roast

Yes, that's right - it snapped back like a rubber band into your eye. Ok, so that means that the support level that I suggested held for a 3rd time, making it very reliable.

And to add some sugar to that sweet potato pie, the stock closed up $3 from the low and a bullish pattern formed throughout the whole day - the cup and handle (""C+H"").

If you don't know what the C+H pattern looks like, go to your mom's breakfront where she keeps all the tchotchkes and the fine china and take out a tea cup. Hold it up and look at it from the side, with the cup's handle on the right side. Then look at the screenshots I uploaded. It's the same thing.

This mean stock go up.

Interesting how NVDA held at that support level and then the entire day formed a C+H pattern... Hmmm... 

Smells bullish, that's the vibe.

wallstreetbets,ERJ - This stock is challenging two behemoths and I like their chances,"This is obviously not financial advice. I just like the stock and I want to talk about it.

Embraer recently hit it's highest price in the last 10 years and it comes after a disastrous failed merger with Boeing in 2020. They spent years prepping the company for the merger and were left with their dicks hanging out when Boeing backed out last minute (Broke ass Boeing didn't have the money to go thru with the acquisition). It was the best thing that could've ever happened to them. 

With a new CEO and a new direction, Embraer is setting itself up to challenge both Boeing and Airbus in the near future. They're already the third largest commercial air aircraft manufacturer in the world and their market share only increases with the higher demand from Airlines for fuel efficient aircrafts and their growing Military and private jet segments.

Embraer aircrafts will soon be 100% of American Airline's regional fleet and many other orders to come. Also, passengers absolutely love the experience of flying on an Embraer. 

Another interesting thing about Embraer is their track record on innovation. I'd recommend you guys researching and reading up on their EVE project. They're basically leading the field in the urban air mobility segment (basically taxi/uber but with planes) and it seems very promising. They are developing a small electric aircraft intended to be used for short urban travel (up to 100 KM /60 miles).

That being said, I have to confess one the biggest reasons I like ERJ is because it would be a tremendous FUCK YOU to Boeing if they stole their share of the market. ERJ stock price is already higher than Airbus although Airbus has a much larger Market Cap. But fuck them too. ERJ to the fucking moon. 

I'm absolutely new to the stock game and should not be trusted. But I do invite you guys to learn more about this company.

If one of you regards want to take a look at their Q3 returns, here is the link: https://embraer.com/global/en/news?slug=1207478-earnings-results-3rd-quarter-2024 

I also would recomend reading this interview from their CEO. He shares his vision for the future of the company and how they want to get there:https://fortune.com/2024/10/21/ceo-embraer-aerospace-company-rewrote-strategy-boeing-joint-venture-loss-francisco-gomes-neto/

wallstreetbets,PLUG - and the Hydrogen sector - is primed to go up big,"How do you do, fellow autists? Today's DD is an older meme, but it checks out. That's right, our favorite hydrogen power play - PLUG.

PLUG Power's revenue has been growing fast over the past few years. In their most recent quarter, they reported $260 million in revenue, which is a huge jump compared to where they were just a year ago. This shows that their hydrogen tech is really starting to take off, and they're making big strides in building up their customer base.

What's even better is their gross profit is improving too. They've gone from some pretty hefty losses in the past to now getting closer to break-even. That means they're really starting to scale up. They’ve been investing heavily in R&D and infrastructure, but those costs should start paying off soon.

And here’s the kicker—PLUG is locking down major partnerships and contracts with huge players like Amazon, Walmart, and Home Depot.

Other catalysts:

1: PLUG looking to get a $1.8ish billion loan from the government

2: Possible old CEO stepping down to insert new blood.

wallstreetbets,"How is MSTR's bond scheme different than the mortgage bonds of the early 2000s, and not worse?","They're merely senior debt obligations of a company that owns severely volatile assets. It's literally a Collateralized Debt Obligation. The Debt Obligation being the bond, and the Collateral is the MSTR stock, except there are no tranches, or at least the current offerings are equivalent to the Senior/AAA tranche.

If/when the BTC market tanks like the housing market tanked, MSTR bond holders receive MSTR stock. After a crash, this stock will be as (not) valuable as a top level tranche of a mortgage backed bond structure based on shitty loans. Then the mortgage holders had to sell off or have to go through the foreclosure process and (hopefully) let the money flow back in the chain.

But you can't foreclose on Bitcoin......

wallstreetbets,"Red Cat Holdings, Inc. (RCAT) Due Diligence Report  ","**Company Overview**

Red Cat Holdings, Inc. is a technology company specializing in the development of drone systems and solutions for military and commercial applications. In response to the United States renewing bans on DJI drones through legislation such as the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and the American Security Drone Act, Red Cat focuses on providing advanced, domestically produced unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and related technologies. The company's products aim to enhance drone operations while addressing national security concerns by supplying secure, American-made drone solutions. Through its subsidiaries, including **Teal Drones** and **FlightWave**, Red Cat offers products that support reconnaissance, surveillance, and other critical functions, delivering innovative solutions to defense organizations and industries requiring drone capabilities[.](https://imgur.com/a/8E9PtMl)

**Investment Thesis**

Jeff Thompson, CEO of Red Cat Holdings, has outlined significant developments that position the company for substantial growth and potential undervaluation in the market. The following points highlight the company's strategic advantages and growth prospects, incorporating recent developments from the company's earnings call and industry dynamics.

# 1. Significant U.S. Army Contract

**SRR Program Win**

* **Contract Award**: Red Cat's subsidiary, **Teal Drones**, has been selected as the sole winner of the U.S. Army's **Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR) program**, securing a contract to deliver **5,880 systems**. Each system includes **two drones and one controller**, amounting to a total of **11,760 drones**.
* **Contract Value**: The average price of a system is around **$45,000**, depending on configuration. This implies a base contract value of approximately **$264 million**.
* **Competitive Edge**: Teal Drones was chosen over better-funded competitors like Skydio, which has raised over **$700 million** in venture capital. Despite being an underdog, Teal's technological advancements and ability to meet the Army's stringent requirements led to this significant win.

**Additional Revenue Streams**

* **Maintenance and Support**: The contract includes provisions for repairs, training, and spare parts, which could increase the contract's value by an additional **50-70%**. Historically, programs of record have seen significant revenue from spares and support over many years.
* **Expansion Potential**: The SRR program's success positions Red Cat to secure additional contracts with other military branches, U.S. government agencies, and NATO allies.

**Program of Record Status**

* **Simplified Procurement**: Achieving **Program of Record** status streamlines the procurement process for other defense organizations, allowing them to purchase directly off the SRR contract. This designation enhances credibility and accelerates additional orders and long-term partnerships.

# 2. Anticipated Growth and Revenue Projections

**Projected Revenues**

* **Fiscal Year Projections**: The company has provided guidance of **$50-55 million** for calendar year 2025, based on the initial phases of the SRR contract.
* **Potential Upside**: With additional appropriations and the possibility of accelerated procurement, revenues could increase significantly. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) includes approximately **$79.5 million** in funding for the program line that supports SRR.
* **Long-Term Outlook**: Including potential additional contracts and support services, annual revenues could reach around **$100 million**, excluding new contracts.

**Future Contracts**

* **International Demand**: NATO allies and other international partners have shown strong interest in the Black Widow drone, especially after the SRR program win. Some opportunities may eclipse the SRR program in size and value.
* **Expansion into Asia-Pacific**: The company is also engaging with Asian allies, such as Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, the Philippines, and South Korea, to explore additional sales opportunities.
* **Replicator Initiative Participation**: Red Cat is involved in the Department of Defense's **Replicator program** to mass-produce affordable, autonomous drones, potentially leading to larger future contracts.

# 3. Valuation Compared to Industry Peers

**Market Valuation Discrepancy**

* **Underappreciated Value**: Despite securing a landmark contract and demonstrating significant growth potential, Red Cat's market valuation remains lower than private peers like Skydio, Anduril Industries, and Shield AI.

**Revenue Multiples**

* **Industry Comparison**: Competitors are trading at revenue multiples ranging from **18× to 28×**. For instance:
   * **Shield AI**: Trading at **18.4×** revenue.
   * **Anduril Industries**: Trading at **28×** revenue.
   * **Skydio**: Recent valuation at **$2.2 billion**, trading at **22×** revenue.
* **Red Cat's Multiple**: Based on the company's guidance, Red Cat trades at a significantly lower multiple, suggesting substantial upside potential when aligning with industry standards.

**Upside Potential**

* **Implied Valuation**: Using projected revenues of **$100 million** and applying a conservative industry revenue multiple of **20×**, Red Cat's implied market capitalization could be **$2 billion**.
* **Implied Stock Price**: With approximately **75.5 million** shares outstanding, this valuation translates to an implied stock price of approximately **$26.49** per share.
* **Potential Upside**: This represents an approximate **182% increase** from the current stock price of **$9.39**.

# 4. Strategic Capital Management

**No Immediate Capital Raise**

* **Financial Flexibility**: The company has filed a **$100 million mixed securities shelf registration**, allowing Red Cat to issue various types of securities over time. However, management has indicated **no immediate plans** to raise capital through equity offerings.
* **Utilizing Debt Instruments**: Red Cat has room on its existing debt instrument and may use this for short-term capital needs, minimizing shareholder dilution.

**Minimal Capital Raise if Needed**

* **Operational Continuity**: Any potential capital raise would be around **$10-15 million** to ensure operational efficiency without significant dilution.

**Investor Assurance**

* **Fiscal Responsibility**: CEO Jeff Thompson emphasizes a prudent approach to capital management, focusing on maximizing shareholder value and achieving cash-flow-positive operations.

# 5. Product Development and Expansion Opportunities

**Advanced Drone Focus**

* **Teal's Black Widow Drone**
   * **Technological Advancements**: The **Black Widow** is a **3-pound**, folding, backpack-size drone capable of flying autonomously without GPS, using an internal map for navigation.
   * **Electronic Warfare Resilience**: It can operate without emitting radio frequencies for up to **40 minutes**, making it less susceptible to detection and jamming—a critical advantage in modern warfare.
   * **Features**: Rugged, reliable, fully modular, quiet, long flight time and range, high-resolution cameras, stealth modes, onboard compute for AI and autonomy, capability to carry secondary payloads, and operation in electronic warfare environments.
* **Webb Controller**

   * **User-Centric Features**: Easy to use, comfortable to hold, modular, supports RF silent and stealth modes, uses the same battery as the drone, simplifying logistics.
* **Manufacturing Capabilities**
   * **High-Volume Production**: Teal has designed the Black Widow and Webb for **mass production**, with the capacity to produce **hundreds of systems per month** in low-rate initial production (LRIP) and scaling to **thousands per month** by the end of next year.
   * **Scalability**: The manufacturing facility can increase output by adding shifts, including moving to two or three shifts and operating on weekends.

**Edge 130 Drone**

* **FlightWave Acquisition**: Red Cat's acquisition of FlightWave adds the **Edge 130** drone to its portfolio.
* **Order Backlog**: Over **200 orders** for the Edge 130, expected to be delivered in Q1.
* **New Facility**: The company is moving into a new factory to accommodate production needs.

**Mass Deployment Readiness**

* **Scalability**: Red Cat's drones are well-suited for large-scale deployment initiatives like the Replicator program and can meet the high demand seen in conflicts such as Ukraine.
* **Red Cat Futures Initiative**
   * **R&D Focus**: The company is pursuing research and development opportunities to integrate capabilities with strategic partners, enhancing their product offerings and addressing future mission needs.

* **Progress**: Both drones have passed initial testing phases and are moving into the final stage, involving review of bill of materials and cybersecurity practices.

# 7. Competitive Landscape and Industry Challenges

**Competitor Challenges**

* **Skydio's Setbacks**
   * **Operational Failures**: Skydio's drones underperformed in Ukraine, suffering from electronic warfare tactics that led to loss of control and drones going off course.
   * **Loss of SRR Contract**: Skydio lost out to Teal Drones in the SRR program, despite significant venture capital backing.
* **Other Competitors**
   * **AeroVironment's Switchblade Drones**: Faced difficulties due to Russian jamming and GPS blackouts, impacting their reliability.
   * **Cyberlux's Production Issues**: Failed to meet production and delivery goals, affecting credibility.

**Red Cat's Competitive Edge**

* **Technological Superiority**: Red Cat's drones are designed to withstand electronic warfare, operate without GPS, and meet the rigorous requirements of modern battlefields.
* **Mission-Driven Approach**: The company's focus on building drones specifically to meet the Army's needs contributed to winning the SRR contract.
* **Manufacturing Readiness**: Red Cat's ability to mass-produce drones efficiently positions it favorably against competitors who may struggle with production scaling.

# 8. Strategic Partnerships and Government Relations

**Advocacy and Policy Support**

* **Government Engagement**: Red Cat is actively working with the Department of Defense and Congress to ensure funding and support for expanding the SRR program.
* **NDAA Funding**: The National Defense Authorization Act includes approximately **$79.5 million** for the SRR program line, with efforts to increase appropriations in future fiscal years.

**International Opportunities**

* **NATO Allies**: Multiple NATO countries are showing strong interest in adopting the Black Widow drone, with some potential contracts larger than the SRR program.
* **Asia-Pacific Expansion**: Engagement with countries like Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, the Philippines, and South Korea opens additional markets.

# 9. Management and Leadership

**Experienced Team**

* **CEO Jeff Thompson**: Emphasizes fiscal responsibility, strategic growth, and maximizing shareholder value.
* **George Matus**: Founder of Teal Drones, instrumental in designing the Black Widow and Webb controller, focused on meeting Army requirements and soldier feedback.
* **Geoff Hitchcock**: Brings decades of experience from previous roles at AeroVironment, contributing to securing programs of record and international expansion.

**Board of Directors**

* **General Paul Funk II**: Recently joined the board, providing valuable insights from his military experience, emphasizing the importance of kinetic capabilities and battlefield needs.

**Stock Price Potential Based on Updated Calculations**

* **Current Market Capitalization**: Approximately **$480 million** (reflecting recent stock performance).
* **Current Stock Price**: **$9.39** (as per the latest data).
* **Shares Outstanding**: Approximately **75.5 million**.
* **Projected Fiscal Year 2025 Revenue**: **$100 million** (potentially higher with additional appropriations and contracts).
* **Industry Revenue Multiple**: **20×** annual revenue.

**Implied Valuation**

* **Implied Market Capitalization**: $100 million × 20 = **$2 billion**.
* **Implied Stock Price**: $2 billion / 75.5 million shares = Approximately **$26.49** per share.

**Potential Upside**

* **Percentage Increase**: (($26.49 - $9.39) / $9.39) × 100% = Approximately **182% increase**.

**Considerations and Assumptions**

* **Revenue Achievement**: The company successfully achieves the projected revenues through the execution of the SRR contract and potential additional contracts with other military branches, government agencies, and international customers.
* **Market Valuation Alignment**: The market values Red Cat at a 20× revenue multiple, consistent with industry peers.
* **Technological Leadership**: Red Cat continues to innovate and maintain its technological edge over competitors.
* **Production Scaling**: The company effectively scales production to meet demand, maintaining quality and efficiency.

**Conclusion**

Red Cat Holdings appears to be undervalued relative to its industry peers. With a significant U.S. Army contract, anticipated growth, and involvement in key defense initiatives, the company is strategically positioned for potential expansion. The high demand for reliable drones in modern conflicts, combined with competitors' shortcomings, amplifies Red Cat's market opportunity. The company's mission-driven approach, technological advancements, and manufacturing readiness provide a strong foundation for growth.

Investors should consider these factors while also conducting their own due diligence. The discrepancy between Red Cat's current market valuation and that of its peers suggests substantial upside potential.

Greetings my friends, and prepare yourselves. Join me as we learn the wey of gey.

What you see before your very eyes is an experimental portfolio I have made. No real money is involved, but essentially this is a watchlist on E\*Trade with share quantities assigned to each stock to fit my hypothetical allocations.

The purpose of this portfolio--gey.

By tilting heavily to the gey factor, we hope to realize the rawdog premium.

The core of this portfolio is Grindr (GRND). It holds a 27% allocation (I had to convince myself to not make it 30% for diversification's sake, although such is still not off the table entirely). The path of gey is risky, but potentially rewarding. Grindr holds what many consider to be somewhat of a monopoly on the LGBTQ+ dating and hookup market. Only the individual who achieves great wealth from Grindr stock can become a true Lord of the Gey.

The other stocks that makeup The Fruitcake Portfolio are stocks that one might consider to be gey-in-some-wey. In reality, this means we must invest in stocks typically designated ""women"" stocks. Now personally, I love stocks of companies whose target audience is women. Just because the product isn't some sci-fi tech robot A.I. missile etc etc, doesn't mean that it isn't a good company with amazing potential. I personally already own ELF and \[redacted\] in my real accounts. However, in this portfolio, beauty, cosmetics, and baby/household care products (diapers, etc) make up around 26% in total (17% for ELF, 9% for \[redacted\]).

Hims & Hers (HIMS) was selected for it's exposure to the men's sexual health market. They got ED pills, condoms, lube, prostate massagers, cock rings, etc. With the addition of a 10% HIMS allocation, The Fruitcake Portfolio will be on all fours, back arched, with its cheeks up in the air for exposure to the chode of this lucrative industry. In addition to HIMS, there is also a small 2% allocation to Church & Dwight (CHD), because they make Trojan condoms.

FBTC is the Fidelity BitCoin ETF. This is the only crypto play in the portfolio and makes up 10% of the portfolio.

If Warren Buffet has Coca Cola (KO), then The Fruitcake Portfolio has Starbucks (SBUX), because Starbucks is zesty, and therefore, perfectly suited, as those who regularly drink from Starbucks follow the wey of gey. Similarly, Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) is more of a growthy-value stability stock in the restaurant sector. I wanted to originally find a vegan or vegetarian stock, however those tend to fail. However, CAKE actually has been expanding its business lately with the restaurant Flower Child. Flower Child serves vegan, vegetarian, paleo dishes, and more. So yes, CAKE is a bit of a compromise pick, but I think it fulfills the requirement of gey.

There is an 11% allocation split between Victoria's Secret (VSCO), Lululemon (LULU), and Nike (NKE). Overall, this is more of a value play and a smaller weight. VSCO is the primary holding here.

Disney (DIS) and Netflix (NFLX) are tiny allocations to streaming services. Need I explain why they are perfect for The Fruitcake Portfolio? If you are a 35 year old male millennial, and you still visit Mickey Mouse every year and take pictures with Cinderella, then you are no novice to the wey of gey.

Finally, we have a tiny 1% allocation to Google (GOOG). Literally the alphabet company.

Something interesting to note is that this portfolio actually tilts very heavily into midcaps. Once ELF becomes a large cap, then things will be more balanced. I’ve considered adding a SCV as well.

\----------------

For stocks and ETFS that didn't make the cut, I had:

TSLA & FSLR: The wey of gey is partial to EVs and clean energy.

VEGN: Basically a cruelty-free S&P 500. Considered including this and removing a bunch of the large cap stocks in the portfolio.

\[redacted\]: An OTC Malaysian stock that I could probably buy through interactive broker. It's particularly NSFW.

\[redacted\]: Weed Stocks.

TGT: Target is Target.

BBWI: Bath and Bodyworks for scented candles and slippery bathtub moments--with bubbles (ofc).

RVLV: Clothing Retailer.

It's not like there's any geopolitical tension in the region.

If the concerns are just temporary raised fed rates, and sentiment about Lula being a commie so Bolsonarists are just shovelling money out of the country in protest, is this not a great buying opportunity?

wallstreetbets,"Kohl's (KSS) at $15 - Seriously Undervalued, Here's Why 🚀","Alright, gang, hear me out. I think (Kohls) KSS is an absolute gem right now, sitting at $15. Here's the case:

1. Franchise Group tried to buy KSS at $69 per share in April 2022 💸Yeah, you read that right. Franchise Group was willing to pay $69 for Kohl's not even two years ago. The deal was rejected (major facepalm move on Kohl's part), but it gives us a benchmark for what the market thought KSS was worth. Now, let’s take a moment to think about why Franchise Group was willing to pay that much... This wasn't some random offer. Kohls has value. It's just undervalued right now.
2. Oak Street Real Estate Deal – A $2B Real Estate Portfolio 🏢After that rejection, Oak Street stepped in and made an offer to buy a portion of Kohl's real estate for $2B. Wait—$2 billion for a portion of the real estate? At the current market cap of $1.65 billion, that tells you one thing: Kohl's real estate alone is worth more than the ENTIRE company. If we’re being conservative, the real estate portfolio could easily be worth $4-5 billion, which is well above where the stock is trading right now. So, the company’s assets are massively underpriced.
3. 32% Short Interest – Don’t need to tell you guys about potential, you know the drill.
4. Seasonal Play – December to January Pop Historically, Kohl’s stock tends to do well in the December to January timeframe, often gaining around 25-30%. Worst-case scenario, you’re breaking even based on the past 5 years if you’re holding through this period, but with the setup here, I’d bet on a solid upside. Buy in December, sell in January, rinse and repeat.

TL;DR

\* Franchise Group offered $69 for Kohl's in 2022. The stock is $15 today.

\* Oak Street valued Kohl's real estate at $2B for a portion. That’s a huge asset undervaluation.

\* 32% short interest

\* December to January historically sees a 30% upside.

So, what’s the risk at $15? This stock is undervalued and has additional catalysts.

This isn’t financial advice, but this setup has ""degenerate gains"" written all over it. 🤘

wallstreetbets,"Stock is Trading at All-Time Lows with a Sub-$2B Market Cap, $600M FCF, $4B in Assets, and Over 30% Short Interest— Absurd.","Apollo tried to fund a Kohls buyout in 2022 for 8B (nothing has changed drastically about its business between now and then).

Let’s break down Kohl’s ($KSS). The stock is down 20% today, trading at an all-time low with a market cap under $2 billion. Meanwhile, the company generates $600 million in free cash flow (FCF) annually and owns $7 billion in real estate assets. with net assets of $4B.

1.The Business: Kohl’s still did $18 billion in sales for fiscal 2024, even without fully capitalizing on its Sephora partnership, which is boosting foot traffic in every store its been rolled out in (and they continue to roll out more) .

2. Valuation and Cash Flow: •	Kohl’s generated $300 million in net income last fiscal year and nearly double that in free cash flow (FCF): $600 million. Based on this quarter they’ll likely land somewhere in a similar ball park. •	Historically, Kohl’s has averaged $1 billion in FCF, meaning current results are already deeply discounted. And yet, the stock is trading at just 3x FCF. •	The discrepancy between net income and FCF comes from non-cash expenses like depreciation on their $7 billion real estate portfolio. This isn’t “money burned”—it’s accounting noise.

3. Balance Sheet Strength: •	Kohl’s has $14 billion in total assets/4B net, with a large portion being real estate. They own over 400 stores outright—hard assets that could generate significant cash in a liquidation scenario. •	Liabilities are about 11B, Yes, they exist, but Kohl’s is far from distressed, with manageable debt relative to their assets and FCF generation.

4. Short Interest: •	Over 30% of Kohl’s shares are shorted. Shorts betting on total collapse might not fully understand the cash generation and real estate value here. Any positive catalyst—a strategic pivot, real estate monetization, or improved retail sentiment.

5. CEO Departure: •	Kohl’s just announced its CEO, Tom Kingsbury, is stepping down—news that likely contributed to today’s selloff. But here’s the kicker: Kingsbury was adamant about NOT selling Kohl’s assets. His departure reopens the possibility of a real estate monetization play, which could unlock billions in value.

    •	Remember: Kohl’s rejected an $8 billion buyout offer funded by Apollo Global Management in 2022. That was four times today’s valuation.

The Bottom Line: For a $2 billion market cap, you’re buying: •	$7 billion in real estate assets (including 400+ owned stores). •	$600 million annual FCF, even in a “bad” year. •	A company that generates enough cash to pay an 11% dividend yield.

If you told me I could buy $7 billion in hard assets (4B net of liabilities) and $600 million in annual cash flow for under $2 billion, I’d say yes every time. That’s Kohl’s today. This isn’t a growth story—it’s a cash-and-assets story. You’re betting that the business, even if it declines slowly, will return far more than its current valuation. Or that someone with deep pockets will take notice and bid. Either way, this valuation is ridiculous.

Shorts, good luck.

wallstreetbets,MSTR: Don't Mistake Leverage for Genius [DD],"Microstrategy (MSTR) has a simple strategy of using various forms of debt to buy bitcoin. Regardless of your stance on Bitcoin, it begs the question: **why** invest in Microstrategy over Bitcoin? In the words of Steve Eisman, “They mistook *leverage for genius*.”

Sure, Microstrategy is more leveraged than Bitcoin, but you can also leverage your bet on Bitcoin; take out margin, buy a leveraged instrument on an exchange, or, my favorite, taking an extra shift at Wendy's.

So, let's compare the strategy. How would you do if you just bought leveraged Bitcoin instead of Microstrategy, and mimicked their strategy? I'll walk us through returns from the bottom of the BTC bear market on December 30, 2022, until today.

On 30 December 2022, MSTR had a market capitalization of **1.63B.** They held **132,500 bitcoin** valued at $**2.19B** according to their Q4 earnings.

https://preview.redd.it/dw36tu03oa3e1.png?width=916&format=png&auto=webp&s=783ed81a61bb033f974783e70fe2c51899d6325f

Bitcoin was around 16,529 on December 30 2022.

https://preview.redd.it/acmcnyhhoa3e1.png?width=1278&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fc1f50ffa72683d4fc448fe2ef98720ace19ff9

They also had total long term debt of $2.4B.

https://preview.redd.it/k9zzwx15oa3e1.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&s=afa6a2fb9169bf7ec53956d8412f04af423e6316

Note, I'm excluding their current debt and assets from this, as I'm more interested in their BTC holdings vs. their long term liabilities (debt).

Importantly, their core loss-leading operating business was generating about $30M a year of EBITDA. You could easily value this at **Zero**, but a generous 20X multiple of 30M EBITDA would be valued at around \~$600M

https://preview.redd.it/rlnskdbaoa3e1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3029489eb18d94bea7955fd3313210b3a2870eb

So, you were buying a $600M operating business and $2.19B of bitcoin, minus $2.4B in debt, for 1.63B market cap.

Assuming you could just sell the operating business to cover debt and focus on the value of the bitcoin, that would be **$2.19B in bitcoin** and $**1.8B in debt**. So net assets of **390M**.

Owning 2.19B in bitcoin on 390M of net assets is about **5.6x** leverage.

If you took the same 1.63B needed to buy all of MSTR’s market cap at the time and bought bitcoin at 5.6x leverage you would own $**9.128B worth of BTC**, or about **552,241 BTC** at the December 30 2022 prices.

With BTC at 93K today, you would have turned your $1.63B into **$51.3B** if you used 5.6x leveraged BTC, a **3,106%** ROI.

How did MSTR do over the same time period?

https://preview.redd.it/cyc8kfjxoa3e1.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0aac60559159b94bc2815e0bbba7ccfb7d5e5b6

Over the same duration, even with NAV premium expansion, MSTR has returned 2,452%. That's the difference between turning your 1.6B into 41B or 51B. A huge discrepancy!

TLDR; Adjusting for leverage based on MSTR’s bitcoin holdings vs debt, you would have been better off just buying leveraged bitcoin.

wallstreetbets,$VSH - The Forgotten King of Chips,"TLDR: $VSH (Vishay Intertechnology) is printing money while everyone sleeps on it. $VSH just got the stamp of approval from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, confirming it as a hidden winner in Nvidia’s AI and RTX 50 supply chain. With key wins in MOSFETs, capacitors, and resistors, $VSH is now primed for explosive growth, riding Nvidia’s dominance in AI servers and GPUs. If you’re not jacked up on $VSH, you’re not meant to have money. 

Who is $VSH?

Vishay Intertechnology is a veteran in the electronics industry. They make essential components like resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, and semiconductors. You know, the boring stuff that makes your GPU, PS5, and electric toothbrush actually work. They’ve been doing this since 1962. That’s right, this company has survived every market downturn, bubble, and chip shortage in the last 60+ years. Meanwhile, you can’t even survive a red day on SPY.

Why $VSH is printing money:

Chips are everywhere—cars, phones, smart homes, AI servers. The global semiconductor market is growing at an insane pace (projected $1 trillion market by 2030). Guess what? Vishay is supplying the guts.

Look at their P/E ratio: 12.5 (as of last check). Compare that to Nvidia’s 75+ or AMD’s 30-ish. $VSH is practically trading at the bargain bin, and yet their revenues are consistently strong.

Vishay’s last earnings report crushed expectations, with double-digit growth in several segments. They’re sitting on $3.4B in annual revenue with plans to scale. Oh, and they’re buying back shares like they’re on clearance at Costco.

Everyone’s hyped about Nvidia because of AI. Guess what? Vishay supplies components used in AI hardware, EV charging stations, and industrial automation. While Nvidia makes the sexy GPUs, Vishay sells the boring but essential resistors and capacitors that keep those GPUs from melting your motherboard. They’re eating up the market share. 

Recent Catalysts: 

Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo dropped a bombshell: Vishay is a key supplier for Nvidia’s Blackwell AI servers (GB200 series, DGX/HGX B200) and the upcoming RTX 50 series graphics cards. These are Nvidia’s future bread-and-butter products, dominating AI and high-end gaming.

Vishay replaced Infineon as Nvidia’s MOSFET supplier. Yes, Infineon, the semiconductor giant, just got sidelined. This Is MASSIVE for $VSH. 

Vishay is providing MOSFET/DrMOS (VRPower), vPolyTan (Polymer Tantalum Capacitors), and Current Shunt Resistors. These components are critical for Nvidia’s most cutting-edge products:
	•	GB200 series AI servers: Nvidia’s next-gen AI infrastructure.
	•	RTX 50 series GPUs: The next flagship graphics cards.
Vishay’s vPolyTan capacitors (especially the T55 series) are already facing a supply crunch for 2025. That’s how in-demand they are.

Kuo estimates that Vishay’s MOSFET production alone will contribute 20%-30% of revenue by 2025—with above-average gross profit margins. The vPolyTan capacitors will add a high single-digit percentage of revenue with significantly above-average margins. Translation? Vishay is printing money.

Vishay’s production lines are already at capacity through 2025. When your biggest challenge is meeting demand, you’re in a good spot.

Beyond Nvidia, Vishay is also poised to benefit from:
	•	Automotive rebound: As EV production scales, Vishay’s components are critical.
	•	IoT growth: Billions of devices mean billions of tiny components. Vishay is at the center of it.

The Stock Is Still Cheap

Even after today’s 7% jump to $18.35, $VSH is wildly undervalued. As I said earlier, the P/E ratio is still around 12-13, compared to Nvidia’s 75+. This is a company with real earnings, real dividends, and real growth potential. This is a great opportunity to make back everything you lost from your MSTR calls.

wallstreetbets,FNMA: Come back in 2026/2027,"For those of us that have followed the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac trades since they went into conservatorship, my theory is that it's worth waiting until the end of 2026. Here's my thinking:

* Political
   * Trump likely wants to privatize Fannie and Freddie. He looked into it his first time but the major things holding it back were capital reserves and political will.
   * With a Trump 2nd term, reducing the size of government is one of his biggest goals. In general, privatization is one of the most common ways of doing this. Given that Fannie and Freddie were taken over in 2008, this makes them a prime candidate to be re-privatized. 
   * Republicans have the power in Congress at the moment. 
* Financial
   * At the time, based on the plan and rules they would need about $275-300B in reserves. They currently have about $165B in reserves. In recent years, they generate about $25B in net income per year. While that's about a $100B gap, they can also raise capital through private and public means (private investors, issuing stock). 

Why 2026? Pure speculation from here on:

* Financial
   * In 2 years, they will be in a better capitalized position. They will likely have made about $50B more in income, thus having a total of about $215B in reserves and about a $50B gap in capitalization needed. Given their economics and situation, it could be a tempting investment for investors (particularly hedge funds). 
* Political
   * While this is in line, philosophically, with what Trump wants to do, it won't be a money saver and thus not likely a priority under say DOGE. This would be more symbolic and thus, in my thinking, is a lower priority. 
   * I'm guessing 2024-2026 will be somewhat politically turbulent. This will be the time that Trump takes his biggest swings in terms of cuts to the government since the Republicans control Congress. They will expend political capital to make controversial changes. Therefore, they will focus on their highest priority changes.
   * We have to see what happens to Congress in the 2026 elections. In recent history, Congress has changed power from one political party to another (I believe in 2008 Dems won power under Obama, but then Republicans gained power in 2010). If the Dems win back the balance of power in 2 years, there may not be the political will to privatize. The Dems will sell a fear message around housing affordability, increased costs to borrowers so that they can retain power and control over an important political tool. 

Conclusion

If I were to place odds, it feels feels like a latter-half Trump term initiative. And the best odds are only if Republicans retain power in both houses of Congress in order to pass a bill to make this happen. They're in healthy positions but a couple more years of making money will put them in a financial sweet spot for it to be supported by politicians. 

Even then, it's quite complex and likely is years in the making. But the stock will move if the possibility of privatization in the near term becomes visible. 

If Democrats take power back in Congress in 2026, this isn't a place I'd bent money. Same goes if they win the presidency in 2028. There's also a possibility that the government wants to make major changes to how these types of government-sponsored enterprises are structured, making privatization a much more complicated matter.",12,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1h0hf9d/fnma_come_back_in_20262027/,u followed fannie mae freddie mac trade since went conservatorship theory worth waiting end here thinking political trump likely want privatize fannie freddie looked first time major thing holding back capital reserve political trump nd term reducing size government one biggest goal general privatization one common way given fannie freddie taken make prime candidate reprivatized republican power congress moment financial time based plan rule would need b reserve currently b reserve recent year generate b net income per year thats b gap also raise capital private public mean private investor issuing stock pure speculation financial year better capitalized position likely made b income thus total b reserve b gap capitalization needed given economics situation could tempting investment investor particularly hedge fund political line philosophically trump want wont money saver thus likely priority say doge would symbolic thus thinking lower priority im guessing somewhat politically turbulent time trump take biggest swing term cut government since republican control congress expend political capital make controversial change therefore focus highest priority change see happens congress election recent history congress changed power one political party another believe dems power obama republican gained power dems win back balance power year may political privatize dems sell fear message around housing affordability increased cost borrower retain power control important political tool conclusion place odds feel feel like latterhalf trump term initiative best odds republican retain power house congress order pas bill make happen theyre healthy position couple year making money put financial sweet spot supported politician even quite complex likely year making stock move possibility privatization near term becomes visible democrat take power back congress isnt place id bent money go win presidency there also possibility government want make major change type governmentsponsored enterprise structured making privatization much complicated matter,0.0998606889564336,Positive

wallstreetbets,Orange Juice Crisis,"# Overview

There is currently an ongoing orange juice crisis. Here, I explain what is happening in the orange market, and what metrics/information an orange investor should look out for.

# Context: A Perfect Shitstorm of Weather and Disease

Orange juice has become very expensive. So much so, that OJ has been one of the top performers in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (excluding BTC) since 2020. Below is a graphical representation.

https://preview.redd.it/isa4u6bz273e1.png?width=1964&format=png&auto=webp&s=4351eccf9b1ea2066b8d282a3907fcc913dd41e5

*Fig 1. Orange Juice Futures (candlestick) vs. major commodities, Crude Oil (Green), Copper (Blue), Gold (Purple), Silver (Mint), Soybeans (Red).*

Since 2020, OJ has risen in price by more than 350%. This dwarfs the performance of other major commodities, some of which had arguably very good runs themselves.

So what exactly happened to OJ? There are two, both of which concern the crop’s supply side: adverse weather events and citrus greening.

First, on adverse weather: climate change is nothing new. As of late, however, the damage done to crops due to extreme weather effects seem to be on the rise both in terms of frequency and intensity. It also just happens so that Brazil was hit the hardest, recording its hottest ever temperature in 2023. This is serious news for OJ, [because Brazil alone supplies 70% of the world market](https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/29/orange-juice-makers-consider-other-fruits-prices-bananas-brazil-harvest). Needless to say, extreme heat is never good for crops - for oranges in particular, it significantly increases premature fruit drops, which diminishes yields for plantations.

*Fig 2. Brazil Change in Average Mean Surface Air Temperature, 1901-2022; source: World Bank Group. Temperature in Brazil has been steadily increasing since the 1950s.*

https://preview.redd.it/km8qgzz2373e1.png?width=1224&format=png&auto=webp&s=36aaca2f3672e891af577970747021bc7131fdd4

*Fig 3. Brazil Change in Distribution of Average Maximum Surface Air Temperature, 1951-2020 ; source: World Bank Group. Not only has the average temperature been rising in Brazil, the extremities of droughts are also trending upwards. Extremities are the real crop killers.*

To get the absolutely worst outcome, combine this with a tree disease that has no known cure: citrus greening. Citrus greening causes citrus fruit to stay green instead of ripening, turning it bitter and inedible, and causes the trees to produce less fruit over time. Once a tree is infected, it typically dies within 5-10 years. There is currently no known cure. The disease is also highly contagious. [Virtually all trees in Florida, which used to top even Brazil in OJ production at one time, is infected by citrus greening](https://news.mongabay.com/2024/04/florida-citrus-growers-hope-push-pull-agroecology-method-will-save-their-industry/). Florida barely produces any oranges these days, and most juice makers have already left their groves (Fig 4). As for Brazil, \[Fundecitrus estimated in 2023 that 38% of the plants in the Brazilian citrus belt had symptoms of citrus greening\]([https://calfruitandveg.com/2024/01/25/citrus-greening-hlb-impacting-brazilian-citrus-crop-annual-report/#:\~:text=The citrus belt%2C however%2C also,have symptoms of the disease.)](https://calfruitandveg.com/2024/01/25/citrus-greening-hlb-impacting-brazilian-citrus-crop-annual-report/#:~:text=The%20citrus%20belt%2C%20however%2C%20also,have%20symptoms%20of%20the%20disease.)).

*Fig 4. US Domestic Production of Oranges. Florida now makes less than 1/10 of what it used to make just 20 years ago. Most citrus trees died due to citrus greening, and most grove owners never replanted.*

As a result, OJ inventory is currently at historically low levels (Fig 5, Fig 6), which explains the squeeze in its price. [USDA estimated that the 2022-2023 growing season for citrus was the least productive since 1936.](https://www.wusf.org/environment/2023-05-08/20-year-fight-citrus-greening-florida-farmers-researchers-exhausted)

*Fig 6. US OJ cold storage stocks. Inventory has decreased from 620 million lbs in 2021 to 210  in 2024; a near 70% drop in just three years.*

# Future of Orange Juice

So where will the price of OJ be in the next few years? This is where we get into speculative territory, though the most natural response from a degen ape would be to short the hell out of this thing. Before we do so, however, let us look at some reasons why OJ will have no choice but to come down in price.

**(Somewhat) Predictable Nature of the Niño Index**

Extreme heat that damages crops in Southern Brazil (where the citrus belt is located) is almost always accompanied by El Niño. El Niño occurs when the Pacific Ocean near the equator becomes unusually warm, causing global weather disruptions like droughts in some areas and flooding in others. La Niña is the opposite pattern, where the same region of the Pacific becomes cooler than normal, also affecting weather worldwide but generally causing opposite effects in affected regions. These patterns affect the crop conditions for each country differently, based on its geographical location. For Brazil, and the citrus belt in particular, El Niño is the more serious problem, because El Niño generally brings heat while La Niña takes it away.

https://preview.redd.it/7etys2n8373e1.png?width=2498&format=png&auto=webp&s=6baeac6f66db2abbd2b3f8a236c72d8609153882

*Fig 7. Niño Index; source: Golden Gate Weather Services. Just from a glance, the index seems to closely resemble a normal distribution. Extreme events happen at lower frequencies than less extreme events, and the index oscillates between El Niño and La Niña in a predictable pattern.*

Heat was a greater contributor than citrus greening in lowering Brazil's citrus production in the 2022-2023 growing season (CitrusBR). This means that as long as we don't see another very strong El Niño in the near future, we can be assured of successful orange harvests in Brazil. Based on historical data (Fig 7), the Niño index seems to follow a normal distribution, with La Niña usually following strong El Niños. Given the fact that we just had a very strong El Niño in 2023, there seems to be a slim chance of another one happening within the next few years.

If this is true, a cooler temperature in Brazil for the next 1-3 years should increase output and put downward pressure back on the price of OJ. Strong caveat: nobody can forecast the weather with 100% accuracy. That is why I say 'somewhat'. But the math seems grounded, and nature at least mean-reverting.

**Substitution Effect**

We can also rely on macroeconomic forces to make forecasts.

OJ is not a need. It is also has many substitutes. Consumers have a variety of juices to choose from in the supermarket. If OJ is too expensive, they can easily buy apple or grapefruit juice. Moreover, [retail juice makers (e.g., coca-cola) are looking to use alternative fruits like mandarins to produce their orange juice](https://www.newsweek.com/companies-may-stop-using-oranges-make-orange-juice-1905954).

Therefore, in the long-term, even in the unlikely scenario where the citrus supply shock never recovers, high prices for OJ will drive demand down, ultimately leading to a lower price. High price is the cure for high prices for goods that have clear substitutes and are not Veblen.

**Potential Cure for Citrus Greening**

[Scientists in Florida may have found the cure for citrus greening.](https://theconversation.com/trees-own-beneficial-microbiome-could-lead-to-discovery-of-new-treatments-to-fight-citrus-greening-disease-232681) However, the work is only preliminary and more time and tests will be needed to prove its efficacy.

# Notes on Trading OJ

OJ can be shorted on ICE Futures. 1pt move on an OJ contract translates to a $150 P/L. Current price of OJ is 513.10. The average price of OJ pre-supply shock was approximately 130. Assuming that the current price reverts back to the mean, an investor can therefore expect to make a profit of $57,450 with a \~$20k maintenance margin per contract. The actual profit will most likely be lower, however, because of the big spreads in OJ (OJ is not a liquid contract) and rollover risk. Still, OJ presents a good opportunity for speculators at this point in time, for reasons mentioned above.

wallstreetbets,RedCat DD,"I’m back with the RedCat DD that I promised. 

RedCat is an American Drone company that, as of last week, has been chosen as the sole provider of small, rucksack portable, attritable drones bringing surveillance and strike capabilities, to none other than the United States Army. 

Through a program of record initiated 5 years ago, Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR), the US Army was able to test, research, evaluate and compare capabilities/limitations of drones from 37 companies including Boeing, Lockheed Martin and the “reigning champion” from SRR tranche 1, Skydio. They also fielded these drones in Ukraine to determine resistance to electronic warfare and signal jamming in combat against a modernized and “competent” near peer adversary. Needless to say, RedCat provided a far superior drone, purpose built for the warfighter and was subsequently chosen as the contract winner. 

“Oh it’s one little Army contract for around 12,000 drones, how is that important?”

Great question, looks like not everyone in this sub rides the short bus to school. 

As mentioned previously, SRR testing began in 2018. Now who was paying attention to something other than the big red line that was your portfolio in 2022? Just 4 years after the Army identified the potential viability of drones in wartime? Yep, you got it. Russia invaded Ukraine. Here’s a sticker for you to add to your helmet. If you haven't been watching the drone footage from the Ukrainian war, you should probably get on that. 

Drones have completely changed the battlefield. Ukrainian forces are currently using/losing at LEAST 10,000 drones a month, with some 30,000+ drones in the air everyday. To reiterate, 5 years ago, before Russia invaded Ukraine, before drones were proven in combat, before Ukraine was burning through 10,000 a month to fight one of our near peers, the Army decided they would like about 12,000. 

Do the math. Do you believe the largest and most powerful land force on Earth would order 2 weeks worth of drones and call it good? You know the answer to this question. Why don’t you have free medical care? Why do you have 100k in student loans? Why will an ambulance ride bankrupt you?

Fantastic, you’re right again. 13.3% of the US Federal budget goes straight to the DOD. A cool $820 billion. I’m sure you’re losing focus but I’m certain your wife’s boyfriend can keep her company for a little bit longer. Now add this one up. If you are engaged in conflict with another world power, where do you want to put your money? Do you want to buy the 50k drone that can target anything from the sky, completely unmanned, or do you want to spend 10 million on a single M1 Abrams tank that will take a critical hit from an FPV attack drone, killing the entire crew? 

Let me say this another way. You are America and will stop at nothing to maintain your position as the superior global superpower. Are you buying 5 tanks or 1,000 drones? 1,300 drones or a single F-18? 13,000 drones or 10 F-18’s? How about raising taxes and buying both.

I am not the Secretary of Defense but I can assume an intricate cost benefit analysis is being conducted by US military leadership. In the very near future, the DOD will be acquiring more than 12,000 drones, a whole lot more. 

In case you aren’t aware, the US Army is America’s largest branch of the armed forces. This means they have more money to R&D than their counterparts. With some second level thinking you can understand this to mean if another branch of the military can wait for a wealthier branch to spend millions/billions finding the best product, and buy it after they do, they’ll do exactly that. This reality extends beyond the American DOD. 

How about Australia? Here’s a start. 

https://ir.redcatholdings.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/158/red-cat-to-supply-flightwave-edge-130-blue-systems-to-royal-australian-navy

“Red Cat to Supply FlightWave Edge 130 Blue Systems to Royal Australian Navy”

I hypothesize allied armed forces have been patiently awaiting the conclusion of big Army’s testing to determine where they will also be sourcing their combat drones. SRR is really only the beginning. 

For those interested in semiconductor plays that also understand the importance of Taiwan, you might want to give these articles a read. 

https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2024-09/news/us-supply-taiwan-attack-drones

https://news.usni.org/2024/07/01/hellscape-swarms-could-be-as-cost-effective-taiwan-defense-says-report

The future of warfare is unmanned systems fighting other unmanned systems. Why did we leave Vietnam? Unpopularity back home, moms had enough of losing their sons. How long can America sustain a war outspending USD? When America’s cost of war is cheap drones instead of billions and American lives, we might just deter our adversaries in a way they don’t want to engage us anyways. 

That leads me to the next point. Drones as a deterrence factor. How many drones operating autonomously in a swarm is enough? How many does the entire DOD need on hand? How many do our allies want? 100,000? 200,000? A million? How many combat drones do you speculate that America’s military industrial complex wants on hand? I can’t give you a definitive answer so unfortunately you’ll have to take a quick break from licking that window and use your own reasoning skills. I can say, however, that I’m pretty confident about where they will be sourcing these drones.

Now, enough “market” analysis. Let’s talk about some numbers. u/CynicalMelody was kind enough to post this on a previous post of mine the other day.

“Here is my prediction Stock Price Potential Based on Updated Calculations
Current Market Capitalization: $708.997 million

Current Stock Price: $9.39

Shares Outstanding: Approximately 75.5 million

Projected Fiscal Year 2025 Revenue: $100 million

Industry Revenue Multiple: 20× annual revenue

Implied Valuation:

Implied Market Capitalization: $100 million × 20 = $2 billion

Implied Stock Price: $2 billion / 75.5 million shares = Approximately $26.49 per share

Potential Upside: (($26.49 - $9.39) / $9.39) × 100% = Approximately 182% increase”

This analysis does not include what will be awarded in the future. 

The stock market is forward looking. Now look forward so you can get an edge. The US drone industry is currently estimated to be worth around 3.94B, expected to increase to 8.65B by 2034. 

https://www.precedenceresearch.com/military-drones-market#:~:text=Military%20Drones%20Market%20Size%2C%20Share,7.95%25%20between%202024%20and%202034

Sure maybe the American drone industry will only double over the next 10 years, the thing is, all bets are off if/when we go to war. Where will that money go? 

If you believe global tensions are rising and war is imminent, where is your capital going to be safest? This is your opportunity to build some conviction. How will the US stock market hold up if we go to war? Individual companies? How about if we don’t? Answer those same questions but with RedCat. We get sucked in and large scale war begins, VOO -25%, RCAT +60%. Place your bets.

By current business prospects, RCAT is criminally undervalued. It should have traded at $12 the moment the SRR winner was announced. Also, is there a more reliable source of consistent payments/business than providing services to the US military/government?

This image was not my work, but here is some price modeling data.



If you can buy cheaper than $12, you’re getting a deal. If you understand the gravity of the SRR win, there is much more to follow. This is a chance to buy something that you would hold for a year. Most of yall have never heard the word “profits” so taxes isn’t a problem for you, but for the 6 people in here that aren’t regarded, this is a play you can hold for a year and pay long term capital gains on your gains. Buy calls, exercise them or sell them, buy shares keep them, whatever you wanna do. This company is promising with a bright future. I do apologize that I didn’t post this earlier. I have been working with the mods to get this posted as soon as it was allowed. (Until a few days ago it’s been under 500M market cap. Wanted and tried to post DD back in July)

wallstreetbets,"$CBL: The Shopping REIT that Screws Banks and Has 2-3x Upside to Comps
","***TL;DR at Bottom for my ADHD brethren.***

CBL is playing 4D chess in the retail REIT game. Unlike the high majority retail REITS I’ve seen, it has non-recourse loans. What does that mean? It means that if a property isn’t pulling its weight, they just toss the keys back to the lender and walk away. To simplify:

1. CBL buys a property with loans (like a mortgage)
2. Property works out - CBL wins
3. Property doesn’t work out - CBL can simply walk away and the bank takes the property, but ***cannot go after other assets!*** CBL only loses what they put in (analogous to down payment... not a huge L)

This is combined with some excellent operational performance compared with peers. Depending on what comp you use, it seems like CBL could fairly be 2-3x higher in stock price. It has **better** operating metrics and ROIC:

https://preview.redd.it/cpx617lh763e1.png?width=1286&format=png&auto=webp&s=119457849d20a7ace07d57e732056d0040ab4f46

*So, if it’s so great, who owns it?*

Well, there’s 64.5% insider ownership… this is insanely high so management and insiders like Oaktree (Howard Marks) think it looks good. But this has a side effect that is negative for exposure: it also makes the float low, so institutions can’t easily buy in. But to solve this problem, CBL is using its 17% cash flow yield to buy back shares. They've nuked 8% of the float in buybacks this past year which means there is significant upward buying pressure. 

So essentially, this company has emerged from distress having offloaded shitty properties, and is now printing cash, buying back shares, and bullying lenders. There are several catalysts on the near horizon:

1. Lowered interest rates are pure fuel for this company, so if the economy shows softness, which it has, rates will come down even more and help it.
2. The company recently has had great momentum (+10% in past month) and this indicates more and more interest.
3. New buybacks likely will be announced at next earnings in Feb

*Here’s what makes it especially interesting. As far as I can tell, sh-rts were fairly lazy and just thought:*

“Hmm, this is some random shopping mall REIT, hurr durr let’s sell it. Plus, it emerged from bankruptcy, it must have had bad performance… yep hurr durr” 

This has led to 16% SI which is very significant for this sector.

If you are generally concerned with this play, I would recommend considering a pair trade by shorting one of the other, lesser performing REITs, which should get rid of most sector risk. Then you sit around and wait. Management is insanely aligned with you, the company is on fire, and it’s going to get even better if rates lower. In the meantime, you enjoy cash being thrown off and shares being bought back.

I bought calls that expire after the next FOMC, which should be a good catalyst if they lower rates. I’ve been banking so far:

wallstreetbets,$PCT (Purecycle) is on the prowl and ready to explode. Get in while you can,"So you're rolling in money from AsSTiTs, $RKLB, and $ACHR. You're too scared to YOLO into $MSTR. $PCT is now at a similar stage as when AsSTiTs had their first test satellite in the air or Archer first flew their eVTOL. They've shown it can work; now comes the commercialization and scaling.

PureCycle has invented a revolutionary new way to recycle plastic. Most plastic you put in the recycle bin today [gets burned or thrown away](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/california-sues-exxonmobil-plastic-recycling-deception-rcna172267). They've finally figured out a way to actually re-use this shit (recycle symbol #5) and are scaling up production and signing contrats right now, just so you can get in on the ground floor. Other brands want their product because it makes them look good to their customers that they're using recycled plastic, and it's cheaper too I'm pretty sure.

*1. The Technology*

[https://x.com/PureCycleTech/status/1857423308821795018](https://x.com/PureCycleTech/status/1857423308821795018)

These guys have been dropping corporate hype videos in recent weeks because they're finally getting cocky that their shit works. I'm honestly not exactly sure what's happening here, but it seems like the new plastic they're making in their Ohio factory is pure as hell.

[https://x.com/PureCycleTech/status/1861125793780301911](https://x.com/PureCycleTech/status/1861125793780301911)

Here's another video from today of their CEO flexing their facility in Denver which apparently sources old plastic to make the new plastic. Again not entirely sure what I'm looking at here, but [this guy is a dawg and lives for this shit](https://x.com/private_dataguy/status/1859221977551998988), which is what you want in a CEO. My takeaway is they finally are getting quality old plastic to make into elite new plastic, at scale.

They also have a sick new R&D facility in North Carolina to learn how to keep churning out purer and purer product.

*2. Commercial Demand*

This tech was actually made by P&G and licensed to PureCycle to scale. P&G is their first customer. In addition, [according to their 10-Q](https://ir.purecycle.com/sec-filings-reports/all-sec-filings/content/0000950170-24-127556/0000950170-24-127556.pdf), ""PureCycle has allocated 40% of the Augusta Facility output, for Lines 1 and 2, to existing customers and expects that additional offtake agreements will continue to be negotiated."" I'm pretty sure that means that for their second factory in Georgia, they already have 40% of sales made and are actively working on the rest.

Now that the tech works, their focus this year and Q1/Q2 2025 is commercialization. This is the time to get in, because once they announce those juicy contracts, this thing is gone.

To be clear, this is a risky pre-revenue growth company so scaling is not guaranteed. However, it finally seems to be de-risked enough from a technology standpoint, and the deals they're making now show this.

*3. Financials*

[Their ex-CFO said they were modeling their profit margins to be 40-60%.](https://x.com/private_dataguy/status/1859221977551998988) They're taking shit that people don't want and would actually pay to get rid of and making it useful.

wallstreetbets,Archer (ACHR): Over $6 and Counting—The Journey is Far from Over 🚀,"**Alright everbody, let’s talk about where we’re at with ACHR:**

Since my first post back in October, Archer has climbed **over 100%** and now sits above **$6**. The steep incline has been exciting, but the journey is far from over. Here’s a look at what’s been happening. We’ve got major news, strong forecasts, and institutional backing that keep this play looking solid. Let me break it down:

**Analyst Price Target are Bullish**  
Analysts are projecting an **average price target of $9.69,** with some forecasts reaching as high as **$13.12**. New coverage from Needham just slapped a **Buy** rating on it. The trajectory? Upward.

**381 Funds are on Board**  
Institutional interest in ACHR is growing, with **381 funds** now holding positions—up 8.55% last quarter. Total shares owned by institutions increased by over **10%**, showing confidence in Archer’s growth. Big money sees the potential.

**Insider Activity & Growing Buzz**  
Insider transactions over the past 12 months show strong confidence from within the company:

* **7 insider buys** totaling **28.7M shares**, with only **3 sells** amounting to **3.2M shares**.
* In the last 6 months alone, there were **3 insider buys** totaling over **20M shares**.

This aligns with the momentum we’ve seen recently, with a flood of news, analyst ratings, and community discussions driving ACHR into the spotlight. The buzz isn’t just from the outside, people on the inside clearly see the potential too.

**Major NYC News**  
Archer’s partner **Skyports Infrastructure** and **Groupe ADP** have been selected to operate the **Downtown Manhattan Heliport**, a key move toward bringing electric air taxis to NYC. Together with **United Airlines**, the plan is to electrify the heliport and introduce quieter, cleaner, and more affordable urban air mobility for New Yorkers. This is a massive step forward.

**Global Expansion & Commercialization Strategy**  
Archer’s plans go beyond the U.S., they’re actively positioning themselves for deployment in the **Middle East, Asia, and India**, with key partnerships already in place. Their three-step commercialization strategy is set to begin as early as next year:

1. **Piloted demonstration flights** in key markets.
2. **Market survey trips** carrying passengers on initial air taxi routes.
3. **Full-scale commercial operations** post-certification.

India, with its large urban markets, is shaping up to be one of Archer’s biggest opportunities, supported by their partnership with **InterGlobe Enterprises**.

**Production Facility Nearing Completion**  
Archer’s new manufacturing facility is set to open in the coming weeks. This factory will begin producing **type-design aircraft** next year, ramping up to a production rate of **two aircraft per month by the end of 2025**, with plans to scale even further in 2026. This marks a significant step toward real-world operations and commercial readiness.

**The Journey Continues**  
For those already in, congrats on riding this wave. For those still watching, it’s not too late. After such a strong climb, while some might expect a pullback, in my view, consolidations aren’t guaranteed. Momentum has been holding steady, and the recent news flow has only strengthened the outlook. Even if there are minor dips, there’s no reason to get nervous. Let the doubters and short sellers be the ones sweating it out and reaching for the aspirin. With upcoming milestones like pilot flights and the manufacturing facility launch, the **short-term** and **long-term** potential both look strong.

**TL;DR:** ACHR is up over 100% but still has room to run. NYC, institutional backing, and bullish price targets are lining up to make this a big winner. The ride isn’t over yet, join if you’re ready to see what’s next. 🚀

Wishing everyone a great Thanksgiving and hoping for some gains this week to cover an extra turkey or two! 🦃

wallstreetbets,MSTR Has An Infinite Money Glitch,"Sorry if someone already talked about how this really works. But let's get into the details here on why MSTR is able to get 0% loans on billions every time they do a debt offering. Many people are wondering what kind of morons are buying 0% convertible notes from MSTR. After all, there is a reasonable chance MSTR goes bankrupt if BTC has a sustained bear market around the time these notes mature. And a company like this, you'd expect double digit interest on a loan.

But of course, these are convertible notes. The most recent offering is convertible at \~$670 per share if my napkin math is correct. So they are essentially a 0% loan with a free $670 2028 call option. It turns out, that call option is incredibly valuable. Don't take my word for it, just check the market.

According to Yahoo Finance, a $700 MSTR Jan-2027 call traded around $230-240 on Friday. A Jan-2026 $700 call traded around $185. So you'd expect a 2028 $700 call should be worth nearly $300. So just by buying the note, you're getting about $300 worth of call options per share. You can instantly hedge this position by selling the 2027 call and grabbing $240. This sets up the following scenarios...

1. MSTR goes above $700, your call buyer exercises, you convert your debt to equity to cover the exercise, you net $700 per share + $230 call, you are out the $670/share you used from your principal to convert. You have a gain of $260 on $670 initial for a profit of 38.8%, which takes a maximum of 3 years (expiry of the call option) to materialize.
2. Your call buyer never exercises, you hold through to expiry, you now have your initial investment & keep the full option premium you sold @ $230 per share. You still have 1y+ until your convertible note expires, meaning you can potentially sell another call for added ROI. You pocket $230 for every $670 invested for a gain of 34.3% in 3 years. Eventually the note matures and you get back your initial investment, MSTR is not bankrupt.
3. MSTR goes tits up sometime around 2028. You get to keep the option premium you sold of course, and you will probably recover something from the bankruptcy as well being an unsecured creditor, unless BTC goes to below 10K or something. You'd expect to get back 50-100% of your initial investment with the loan and option premium.

With this in mind, all you need to do is assign probabilities to each outcome. Clearly the financial world thinks that these are a good play. They are able to do this because the IV on their stock is absolutely bananas. This makes their call options incredibly valuable. MSTR is trading volatility for cash. And people are lining up to participate.

So long as the stock remains volatile, which seems likely, they can keep issuing more of these notes and people will be lining around the block to buy them. Meanwhile, they are using the cash to buy BTC which puts huge upward pressure on the market, and subsequently pumps their stock, and creates even more demand for their notes.

Does this end poorly? Probably.

wallstreetbets,PLTR: They said the quiet part out loud [DD],"On November 15, 2024, PLTR's board member Alex Moore tweeted,

>We are moving PalantirTech to Nasdaq because it will force billions in ETF buying and deliver 'tendies' to our retail investors. Player haters be aware that we've been hated for decades (plural). Everything we do is to reward and support our retail diamondhands following.

Immediately afterwards, he deleted his tweet.

At first glance, the statement seems harmless, and even obvious. Companies are added/removed from passive indexes every day, and it's not a crime to want to deliver shareholder returns. There's no problem with boasting about passive index inclusion. It doesn't affect the fundamental business anyway.

Right?

I think otherwise.

Alex Moore said Palantir's quiet part out loud. I contend that this has been Palantir's gameplan since day one. **The stock's performance**, ridiculous valuation, and mania all **points back to one fundamental goal** of the company's management: **manipulating stock market indexes to juice valuation and provide liquidity for insider selling.**

**The Evidence (s/o Mike Green):**

**Part 1: The Listing**

Companies generally list via a direct listing, traditional IPO, or SPAC. For a company the size of PLTR, a SPAC was out of the question. They had to choose between an IPO and direct listing. Let's take a look at both.

**Traditional IPO**: Typically involves investment banks underwriting the deal, setting a price, and selling shares to institutional investors like mutual funds or hedge funds. Importantly, these shares are **not** part of the stock's free float, and insiders must dilute themselves in order to create new shares to sell on the public market.

**Direct Listing**: In a direct listing, a company offers existing shares directly to the public without issuing new shares or raising capital. This avoids traditional IPO underwriters (investment bank). The free float is immediately determined by shares held by insiders available to sell. Palantir chose this route.

**Takeaway:** In a **direct listing**, all existing shares held by insiders, employees, and early investors become eligible for public trading immediately. There is **no lock-up period** (common in traditional IPOs, where insiders are restricted from selling shares for 6–12 months). This approach ensures a **larger float** right from the start, as insiders can sell their shares directly on the public market if they choose, increasing the number of shares available for trading.

Why is this important?

Palantir almost immediately qualified for index inclusion upon its first day of listing. Vanguard and others were forced to buy shares on the **first week** of listing because Palantir met the necessary requirements for most broad market indexes:

1. Market Cap - This is self explanatory, Palantir began listing at \~17B market cap, rendering it eligible for most indexes.
2. Free Float - Indexes are not just weighted by a company's market cap. The S&P500, for example, uses **Float-Adjusted Market Cap**, adjusting the company’s market capitalization based on its free float to determine its weight in the index. Float-Adjusted Market Cap=Share Price×Free Float Shares
3. Liquidity - Also a no brainer, considering the number of shares immediately available for the public, and the hype around the stock.

It doesn't take a genius to see it. As insiders sell shares, the “effective float” rose, requiring extra purchases from index providers, and helping Palantir insiders exit.

[Vanguard = Liquidity ](https://preview.redd.it/630t26f5vy2e1.jpg?width=801&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b54299e2988d9b42437fe9eb7d9db3f407cf904b)

**Part 2: Buying a Seat at the Table**

2021-2022 was tough for Palantir. The index game was faltering as net income and revenue growth lagged. This threatened their ultimate goal of S&P500 + Nasdaq 100 inclusion. They had the market cap, if they could only find a way to juice their revenue in a profitable way to get themselves over the inclusion requirements!

So, they did what any reasonable company in this situation would do, and bought customers. Financing customer growth by [investing roughly $450MM in over two dozen SPACs](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-11-29/palantir-failed-to-spot-pattern-in-spac-debacle), Palantir was basically [buying revenue.](https://www.newcomer.co/p/is-palantir-buying-revenue)

The process was straightforward:

1. PLTR would invest in the SPAC and assume a significant controlling interest
2. PLTR would use the SPAC's funds to purchase PLTR services
3. Any operating losses of the SPAC company could be carefully hidden from PLTR's reporting.

[Not part of operating income!](https://preview.redd.it/ydfikqj6vy2e1.jpg?width=1254&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=19a6a7d123b4cf926e5dd07b1ce374ac30061bb2)

And, soon enough, PLTR was (technically) reporting profitability by GAAP standards! With the company now profitable, in 2024 it became eligible for SP500 inclusion, and was included in September 2024, coinciding with a face-melting rally.

**Part 3: The Next Frontier**

To wind out its strategy, Palantir wants to maximize the benefits of index inclusion, capped off by its **relisting to Nasdaq** to position itself for entry into the Nasdaq-100 (QQQ).

The timing of the move is also suspect. The index’s modified market cap weighting system limits the concentration of its top three constituents, disproportionately favoring mid-tier companies ranked between #10 and #30 in market cap—exactly where Palantir has maneuvered itself.

This move is no coincidence. Palantir’s ownership by the big three institutional investors—Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street—has soared to an impressive **22.23%**, surpassing even tech giants like **Microsoft (20.5%)**, **Apple (20.0%)**, and **NVIDIA (20.17%)**. For a company that only went public in Q4-2020, this level of institutional backing is ridiculous for a company of this size.

And the insiders? They're loving the exit liquidity.

https://preview.redd.it/2ovaqp09vy2e1.jpg?width=1456&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0c9e88a0d96b9b0e6402d50835979bd1d34530e2

In fact, they've been dumping into the institutions (and retail) this whole time:

https://preview.redd.it/2p4k1qx7vy2e1.png?width=1022&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b0be708d61438cdcf2e779d1216cd3e9696140a

""Show me the incentive, and I will tell you the outcome.""

Institutional shareholders through indexes are the easiest exit liquidity in the world for insiders. They're brainless, rules-based buyers. And, once the entire world owns an equal share of your company, priced at 50x sales, and you've dumped most of your shares, you could give a fuck less what the market ultimately does with your stock!

Of course, index inclusion for this stock has coincided with a complete disconnect from the fundamentals. The net \~3B of projected inflows from the QQQ have contributed about 40-50B of market cap growth in just the past few weeks.

Overall, I think there's huge problems with how companies are intentionally trying to juice themselves into indexes, knowing it's full of bloat and thoughtless exit liquidity. PLTR is just one of many, and they're giving a master class in index manipulation as we speak.

TL;DR: The recent PLTR tweet about joining the QQQ was a deeper insight into strategic yet dubious decisions the company has made for years in order to increase institutional ownership to fund insider selling and pump the stock outside of business fundamentals.",1838,357,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gz9jf7/pltr_they_said_the_quiet_part_out_loud_dd/,november pltrs board member

StockMarket,These are the stocks on my watchlist (12/2),"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader.

This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I only hold some/all MAG 7 stocks and market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions. I use IBKR TWS for my platform and charts.

I am targeting potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. This means the potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, not the business, long-term prospects, or the people involved.

PLEASE ask specific questions and PLEASE don’t ask about earnings because I typically don’t take positions before earnings announcements. Questions like “Thoughts on \_\_\_\_\_?” or “Why isn’t \_\_\_ on the watchlist?” or something answered already will be ignored unless you add detail and your opinion.  If you post a question and delete it after I answer it, I will block you- doing that hurts discussion. I am not answering questions if I’m still long or short a stock beyond what I update.

Interestingly enough, a lot of executive replacements today.

Today the company is down again because Citi bank downgraded its rating on NU to a sell.

Why do people care that Citi bank downgraded to a sell? It’s literally a bank that could potentially have to rival NU soon if they break into USA markets. Citi bank is just worried about a rapidly growing, amazing company.

If anything, the downgrade should be seen as a good sign. It shows that american banks like Citi are starting to feel a bit of pressure from how fast NU has been able to expand its user base.

I know Brazil has made changes to its financial regulations. However, NU is rapidly expanding its user base to other countries. Plus, Brazils projected annual GDP growth per year is very good.

* Are there specific signs or market conditions you watch for before rebalancing?

StockMarket,"What's the stock pick you're most proud of? Most ashamed of? ($SQ, $O)","This doesn't have to be your biggest gainer or loser, although it's understandable if that ends up being your choice. What's you're overall gain on the stock? What about your choice are you most proud or most ashamed of? Would you advise investing in it today?

My most proud stock is $SQ, since it's my third highest gainer right now, and it was the first stock where I decided I should sell something I own to buy it. I sold my Disney stock to hold $SQ instead. I believe in cash app, and despite their recent move away from BTC investing, their part in the BTC business, as a place to safely purchase and move BTC to your own wallet reliably, or hold sats if you feel unsure of your own ability to secure your BTC, is highly profitable, moreso with every surge in price. I also thing their small business applications will improve over time, as any tech does. And being a big name early in the game will help in the long run. I also like Jack Dorsey because of his personal commitment to BTC and how he ran Twitter before Elon.

My most ashamed stock is realty income, $O, which despite all the rate cuts has gained less than 3% since I got it xP although has paid some dividends which I didn't reinvest because I didn't know how to yet. The big purchase it made relatively recently did not move the needle for me or apparently any of its other investors.

StockMarket,Thoughts on buying BRK.Binstead of S&P this month?,"
Does anyone have any thoughts on buying BRB.K this month as a one off instead of the usual DCA into S&P 500?

I usually allocate the same amount of money to S&P 500 every month and have done this for years. However given much the stock market is up (27% YTD), especially including the recent trump mania, I think we are due a pull back.

And the way Buffet has been selling stocks recently, so does he. However would spending the same amount this month on Berkshire Hathaway stock instead of S&P, as a one off, hedge against this risk. 

WB has the highest stock pile he’s ever had, whilst still in the market albeit much smaller. I was just thinking it as a way of further diversification - I’ll obviously keep all of my investments in the S&P but as a one off for this month was thinking it could be wise to load up on BH stock, so can receive the benefits of the business of interest from their cash holdings as well as their equity holdings. 

Do you guys think this is a reasonable thought process or just stick to the plan and keep DCAing into the S&P this month?

Thanks.

StockMarket,Evaluating Solar/Wind Companies – Overwhelmed by KPIs,"I’m trying to evaluate a solar/wind company, and I’m finding it much more complicated than analyzing a “normal” tech or consumer company.

There are so many KPIs that I’m struggling to wrap my head around. For example, I’ve come across terms like Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) and MWh produced, but it doesn’t stop there. Other metrics I’ve seen include:
	•	Capacity Factor: How efficiently the company uses its installed capacity.
	•	Installed Capacity (MW): The total capacity of their assets.
	•	Project Pipeline: Upcoming projects in development and their stages.
	•	PPA Contracts: Details of Power Purchase Agreements, like duration and pricing.
	•	O&M Costs: Operations and Maintenance expenses per MWh.

It feels overwhelming compared to the more familiar revenue growth, margins, and user metrics in tech or consumer companies.

How do you prioritize which KPIs to focus on when evaluating companies in this sector? Are there specific ones that are more critical depending on whether they’re utility-scale, distributed energy, or equipment manufacturers?",5,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1h2ig8u/evaluating_solarwind_companies_overwhelmed_by_kpis/,im trying evaluate solarwind company im finding much complicated analyzing normal tech consumer company many kpis im struggling wrap head around example ive come across term like levelized cost energy lcoe mwh produced doesnt stop metric ive seen include capacity factor efficiently company us installed capacity installed capacity mw total capacity asset project pipeline upcoming project development stage ppa contract detail power purchase agreement like duration pricing om cost operation maintenance expense per mwh feel overwhelming compared familiar revenue growth margin user metric tech consumer company prioritize kpis focus evaluating company sector specific one critical depending whether theyre utilityscale distributed energy equipment manufacturer,0.128125,Positive

StockMarket,3 Months of Gains! Let's go!,"Almost 6 months ago, I mutually agreed to part ways with my company. I was President of a Construction Company that was private equity backed and based in Milwaukee. A fun opportunity, and different environment compared to being a serial entrepreneur. Had the opportunity to service hundreds of customers, and build a brand at the expense of someone else! Definitely a cool chapter of my life. Unfortunately, my old man was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer on January 1, 2024 (Happy new year, I guess right?). He currently lives in India, and I split time between Milwaukee and Philadelphia. Without getting into the weeds, I resigned and relocated to India and travel back and forth every 3 months for a couple of weeks.

I decided over the summer, that I would begin full time trading. I have been passively investing in the market for the past 10 years, more active since the beginning of the pandemic. I have taught friends, made and then lost and then recovered and made again, I've been in and out of the market, but I decided to apply my approach at scale.

As an investor, I'm a believer in fundamentals, but also a big value investor. Being a serial entrepreneur and having scaled a variety of businesses in global markets, I have found that I have a deep understanding of valuation and value-prospects, I believe I have a similar approach and understanding to various MMs, and have used that approach intertwined with technical to read the market. My goal was to first generate enough monthly income to cover all liabilities I have on the books, approx. 7-8k per month in fixed expenses. I have multiple accounts where I trade options exclusively, but I decided I would set up a new account purely for trading of equities only.

I told my Old Man there were 251 trading days in a typical year, if I could average 1% per day, I would be able to generate 251% return. LOL... ambitious I know. I did a little math, looked at my trading history, and formulated a pricing strategy for entry and exit in various ticker symbols where I have done a lot of due diligence. It's funny...I found there are some names that I can never win on, and there are some names, that I can just continue to win with (all mental I know...) but I know the price levels realy well. Not every trade is a win, and you'll see that - but I use my losses as ticket symbols to attack on swing trades and recover my losses over the course of the upcoming year.

I created an account in Robinhood with $36,000 opening balance on September 3rd, 2024. I average about $13,000 in margin. I transfer any profits when I close a position and the equity balance is greater than $36,000.

Here are my results!

I completed the first 3 months, as of today, with a 92.26% return (Robinhood's percentages are all messed up because it's counts the withdrawals as capital reduction versus capital gains). I hope I can keep this up going forward! Wish me luck, regards.

[**https://www.benzinga.com/markets/24/11/42050388/high-stakes-and-higher-scandals-inside-wynn-resorts-legal-and-ethical-crisis**](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/24/11/42050388/high-stakes-and-higher-scandals-inside-wynn-resorts-legal-and-ethical-crisis)  


First things first: Steve Wynn, the company’s founder, was key to its brand and success, as they positioned it. But then, in January 2018, the Wall Street Journal revealed sexual misconduct allegations against him, backed by over 150 interviews.  
  
  
These allegations, some dating back decades, led to investigations by Nevada and Massachusetts regulators. Both found Wynn guilty and uncovered a cover-up by senior executives (what a shocker, right?). The result was a staggering $55M in fines for the company.  


After that, the market reaction was fast. $WYNN stock plunged 18% in just days, triggering a lawsuit from investors. They accused the company of hiding Wynn’s misconduct and exposing them to financial risk.  
  


Now, after years of legal battles, Wynn Resorts has agreed to pay a $70M settlement. So, if you owned shares during this time, you might be eligible to submit a claim.



While the company has taken steps to rebuild its reputation — like securing a UAE gaming license, reducing debt, and launching a $1B share buyback program — $WYNN still trades at $93, down 51% from its 2018 peak of $192.

StockMarket,How are smaller companies having such a bad 1-2 years lately but big companies are booming?,"How are smaller companies in good fields taking such a hit over the last 1-2 years but big companies continue to boom?

I’m no expert but that just seems crazy and so inorganic. I get that the company’s themselves aren’t doing well or might have a bad financial year but down 90% or more in a year or two just doesn’t really make sense to me. 

For it to drop like that, it obviously means people are selling but in order for those sales to go through that means people are still buying the stock so somebody still believes in the company. 

And like they could have a bad year where revenue is down 25% or more than previous years, so how does that justify a 90% drop? Or maybe they’re running low on cash, and really the only way to raise cash to help their situation is issuing shares, or a reverse split or whatever. If cash on hand is their biggest problem, wouldn’t making the stock price go up help the company and then lead to more growth? Granted cash-on-hand is probably hardly the biggest factors in these drops but just trying to grow my knowledge. 

I thought the stock market kinda went hand-in-hand in a sense that when big companies are growing, the little ones also follow, kinda like in 2020-2021, now it seems to be the opposite

I guess is that just the difference between big companies and small ones? When hard times come, the big ones are able to adjust and recover and the smaller ones just get destroyed?

And to finish it off, how do you tell the difference between companies that have no hope and will most likely be bankrupt soon, versus those that will most likely make a comeback and recover from being down 90% or more. I feel like it could be a great time to put a little bit of money in these smaller companies but don’t really know how to tell if they’re gonna last or not

StockMarket,Huge Insider Buying at Prospect Capital $PSEC,"Prospect capital's share price took a big hit last month and it was due to an audio forcing them to take a loss on investments that will bring in revenue soon. This dividend stock is way undervalued. And the insider buying lately backs up that thesis.

The CEO has purchased nearly 4.2 million shares or over $20 million! he takes 0 Salary! The President has a salary of 175K and has purchase about that in shares! Every day this week I get SEC filings saying they are buying more. See for yourself:

[https://www.prospectstreet.com/investors/Docs/InsiderFilings/](https://www.prospectstreet.com/investors/Docs/InsiderFilings/)

Yesterday somebody I follow took a call from the company and told us this:

""The Chief Credit Officer at PSEC called me about 11am yesterday. Steven Stone. I was surprised it was from a cell phone. We spoke in February for about 50 mins as well. I have actually met the CEO 3x, last about 13 years ago at an annual shareholders meeting. I first attended in my 20s, was in the city. 1 thing you should know about PSEC is that it is a super defensive stock. The idea is, it is supposed to stay level, about 6, and supposed to give you near 12% in dividends, while having a steady price… We can see that has happened in this market, but that is the idea. It is always good to diversify… I had called and thought the drop off was do to their main REIT business. That business has about 70 multi family properties. Some with 100s of units. Those properties are not prime areas, they are 2^(nd)/3^(rd) tier.. They cash flow well, but on paper, they can depreciate, the asset value, prime can depreciate a lot! So this quarter the value of the REITS were written down much harder than the past, this is determined by their auditor… Every quarter there 117 investments must be appraised…. The loss and bad quarter is on 3 companies. 1 of which they finally did take a write off of near 120 million! PGX a credit repair service. The original owners took out nearly 200 million loan. When they could no longer pay the loan back, as the Govt fined and halted the business, they could not pay it… So PSEC took it over. It has a lot of upside, the margins there are high. We had spoke about this in February and had hoped that the service would be up and running. But it is still shut down, so the auditor forced them to take the loss… This is on paper! They didn’t lose the cash, the cash was loaned out. Hence the EPS will look bad.. They did earn less income because the other 2 of 3 that messed this quarter up, are failing. PSEC suspended interest payments on these 2. 1 of these holds a 180 million loan. PSEC cut the dividend and has chosen to take over these 2 businesses for a turn around. When turned they may sell the business and reap rewards.. Personally, hearing about these other 2, EH! But the credit repair is a cash cow.""

StockMarket,Energy Fuels $UUUU DD,"**Overview**

Energy Fuels, together with its subsidiaries, engages in the extraction, recovery, recycling, exploration, permitting, evaluation, and sale of uranium mineral properties in the United States. The company produces and sells vanadium pentoxide, rare earth elements, and heavy mineral sands such as ilmenite, rutile, zircon, and monazite.

**Explanation of Element and Mineral Importance**

**Uranium –** This is the fuel for nuclear reactors. Please see my post on Uranium if you want to understand the significance of it, and why Energy Fuels will massively benefit from it. Link Here - [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g51fj0/get\_in\_on\_uranium\_now/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g51fj0/get_in_on_uranium_now/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

 

**Vanadium** is a key component in vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), which are used for energy storage systems. Due to shifts toward renewable energy sources, the demand for efficient, large-scale energy storage is increasing. VRFBs are particularly suited for grid storage due to their scalability, long lifespan, and ability to discharge over a long period, making vanadium an essential material for the emerging clean energy economy. This shift represents a significant growth driver for the vanadium market as energy storage technologies become increasingly vital.

https://preview.redd.it/8jf3r5ebv93e1.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9db23e3e0e6bc655f2972abc967ae3283ac808e

**SWOT on VRFBs (Guidehouse Insights)**

The nuclear energy sector represents a significant opportunity for vanadium products. Vanadium alloys are highly valuable due to their low neutron-absorption characteristics and high temperature and corrosion resistance. These properties make vanadium-based alloys ideal for use in nuclear reactors, particularly in the construction of pressure vessels and structural components. The ability of vanadium alloys to withstand the harsh operating environments inside a nuclear reactor without significant degradation, extends the service life of these components, enhancing the overall safety and efficiency of nuclear power plants.

Vanadium is also used in the aerospace industry and plays a huge role in the steel industry as well, due to its ability to enhance the strength and durability of steel.

**Rare Earth Elements (REE’s)**

**NdPr –** A combination of two rare earth elements: Neodymium (Nd) and Praseodymium (Pr). These elements are both crucial in the production of high-strength permanent magnets. Their powerful magnetic properties are essential in: Electric vehicles, wind turbines, consumer electronics, and defense technologies. Energy Fuels is one of the few US companies able to commercialize the production of separated NdPr.

**Growth Projection for REEs in Energy Transition (Source: Adamas Intelligence)**

 

**NdFeB Magnets and Why They Are Important**

Neodymium-Iron-Boron Magnets are a type of permanent magnet. They are the strongest commercially available magnet offering high magnetic strength while being lightweight and compact. With the energy transition going on, demand for these magnets is increasing significantly YoY.

https://preview.redd.it/mdzrojhdv93e1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d175283f0b61f2a74352f03375ef34b359131e5d

**Demand for NdFeB Magnets Worldwide From 2018-2022**

**NdFeB Magnet Content**

As we can see in the chart, NdPr accounts for about a third of NdFeB magnets composition.

**Heavy Mineral Sands**

**Ilmenite –** Mined and processed to produce titanium oxide (TiO2). TiO2 is used in paints, coatings, and plastics which allows UUUU to diversify their revenue further into industrial areas.

**Zircon –** Used for manufacturing ceramics, refractory materials, and foundry molds. Also used in the medical industry for things like dental and orthopedic implants, and for PET imaging which is used for cancer diagnostics.

**Rutile –** Similar to ilmenite, rutile has a superior quality of titanium content making it more valuable.

**Monazite –** A rare mineral that contains rare-earth elements and uranium. Used as a feedstock by Energy Fuels in their processing endeavors. NdPr is extracted from Monazite as well as the minerals mentioned above.

https://preview.redd.it/s4y482vev93e1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=29e6c68d972ac33b6d0b22506f6c5168fb1f924a

**White Mesa Mill**

·         100% owned by Energy Fuels, is the only facility in the USA able to process Monazite to produce REE’s.

·         The only fully licensed and operating conventional uranium mill in the US.

·         Completed “Phase 1” REE facility with up to 1,000 tonnes of separated NdPr production capacity.

·         Largest producer of Vanadium in the US. (Production on standby currently due to low prices, strong inventory on hand.

**Price History**

YTD Return -3.20%.

1 Year Return -17.63.

5 Year Return +244.55%

Average revenue growth for the last 3 years has been 196%.

The negative EBITDA is not something to worry about. Mining sites are not easy to develop and require a lot of funding. Although, once these mines are up and running, heavy mineral sands mining is low cost. They are continuing to focus on creating revenue generating assets. The company has essentially zero debt and very few liabilities, with assets that doubled from 2020 to 2023. In the next year, I believe we will see positive EBITDA due to mines becoming operational, instead of sitting idle.

https://preview.redd.it/shdybkbgv93e1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=2afde2fab62f5cf6b4aabddf9bca9290b66fde22

 

**Q3 2024 Highlights**

·         Very good balance sheet with over $180 million of liquidity and no debt.

·         Uranium prices continue to drive revenue. Sold 50,000 pounds of U3O8 at spot price of $80. Proceeds totaling $4 million, gross profit margin of 54%.

·         New long-term uranium contract. Expected delivery of 270,000-330,000 pounds between 2026 and 2027.

·         Produced 38 tonnes of separated NdPr at White Mesa Mill.

·         NdPr produced at White Mesa is currently being qualified with permanent magnet manufactures and other potential customers, setting the stage for growth.

·         Strong uranium inventory consisting of 235,000 pounds finished U3O8. 805,000 pounds of U3O8 in ore and raw materials. Expects inventory to continue increasing due to mining operations.

·         A large vanadium inventory of 905,000 pounds finished V2O5.

**Acquisition of RadTran LLC**

On August 19^(th), 2024, Energy Fuels announced it acquired RadTran, a private company specializing in the separation of critical radioisotopes. Since 2021, Energy Fuels and RadTran have been working together to evaluate the feasibility of recovering radium-226 and radium-228 from uranium processing at White Mesa Mill. These recovered isotopes would be made available to the pharmaceutical industry and others to enable the production of acintium-225 and lead-212. These isotopes are critical components in the development of targeted alpha therapies which offer promising new treatments for various cancers. There is currently a global shortage of Ra-226 and Ra-228, therefore limiting the supply of Ac-225 and Pb-212. This is a huge acquisition for Energy Fuels as medical isotopes possess immense demand.

**Acquisition of Base Resources**

On October 2^(nd), 2024, Energy Fuels announced the completion of its acquisition of Base Resources. This is expected to transform the company into a global leader in critical mineral production, including titanium, zirconium, REEs, and uranium. This is huge for the company as they brought in world class management and operations capability while gaining ownership over the Toliara Project in Madagascar. This is widely considered by industry experts to be one of the best HMS (heavy mineral sands) projects in the world.

**Conclusion**

I think this is a company with massive potential to be a large player in the supply chain for Vanadium and REEs. With a stockpile of 905,000 pounds of V2O5, they are easily able to capitalize on growing demand. They are also in a great position to capitalize on the growing domestic market for uranium, as we continuously rely less on foreign nations. With 235,000 pounds of inventory on hand and a production capability of 1.1-1.4 million pounds of U3O8 per year, the company will be able to profit from further spot sales and long-term contracts. With strategic acquisitions of Base Resources and RadTran, the company clearly demonstrates commitment to growth and innovation. At a current price of **$6.90**, I believe within 2 years this company will triple in price to around **$20**.",11,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1h0fvp9/energy_fuels_uuuu_dd/,overview energy fuel together subsidiary engages extraction recovery recycling exploration permitting

StockMarket,What caused the major sell down across major world indices in early August?,"Hey everyone,

I have recently started diving into world indices and looking more closely at the trends in global markets. One thing that caught my attention was the significant sell-off in early August 2023 that affected major indices across the globe.

From what I have gathered, there were a number of factors at play, but I am curious to hear your thoughts on what really drove the market downturn. Was it mostly due to economic data (like inflation), bond yields, geopolitical tensions, or something else?

I have been reading about the impact of U.S. inflation, rising bond yields, and concerns over China’s economic slowdown, but I would love to hear from others who have more experience with this. What do you think caused this major sell-off, and how did it affect different global indices?

StockMarket,"AI Spending Isn’t Slowing Down, the Mag 7 Stocks Are Still the Best Bet","Microsoft and Google's parent company, Alphabet, aren't going to stop pouring billions into chatbots.  



Although Nvidia saw a dip due to high market expectations, the long-term outlook for AI remains strong, with chip sales still showing impressive growth. While there’s competition from AMD, the overall demand for AI chips is skyrocketing.  



The Mag 7 remains the key growth driver for AI. Analysts predict these companies will keep growing, with capital spending expected to surge by double digits, reaching nearly $300 billion by 2027 (according to FactSet). Nvidia benefits from chip demand, while Meta drives revenue through advertising.



And even though the Mag 7 has outperformed the market (twice the S&P 500's gains), their valuations are still reasonable—around 27 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, down from over 30 times earlier this year, and near the middle of their historical range (according to Evercore).

StockMarket,$Dell Earnings,"I wanted to get everyone’s take on DELL (down nearly 11% after hours.) I bought 106 shares at 130.5 during their recent run. Didn’t sell today because I like their growth prospects wanted to exit around $150.

The company seems solid, especially with its strength in enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure, even though consumer PC sales have been an ongoing problem. Despite this Dell has been doubling down on AI, data centers, and hybrid cloud, which I believe should set them up well for growth in 2025. They also stand to benefit from SMCI’s issues and Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure. With the growing focus on AI and enterprise tech, it feels like Dell could see steady, long-term growth and break out to that $150 range by Q2 2024.

1, There is a significant correlation between .DJSOEP and oil price.

2, Oil mining output declines, Oil prices rise, oil companies' profits increase, company stock prices rise, and the index rises. The less oil mining, the higher this index is, explaining why it performs better under Biden administration.

3, Trump is preparing to increase oil drilling, plus with the OPEC preparing to increase production, and with the wars in the Middle East coming to an end, oil prices will decline after 2025, so this index will also remain low after 2025.",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1h08g70/whats_the_logic_behind_djsoep_dow_jones_us_select/,djsoep reflects performance company involved oil gas exploration production top holding conocophillips eog resource inc marathon petroleum corporation here guess index please correct significant correlation djsoep oil price djsoep oil price oil mining output decline oil price rise oil company profit increase company stock price rise index rise le oil mining higher index explaining performs better biden administration trump preparing increase oil drilling plus opec preparing increase production war middle east coming end oil price decline index also remain low,0.2708333333333333,Positive

StockMarket,Opening an account other than 401k?,"

Hi everyone,

I started my career a few months ago and have been fortunate enough to have some expendable income. I’m currently contributing about $1,000 per month to my company’s 401k. My portfolio is allocated as follows: 60% in an S&P 500 index fund, 25% in a blue chip growth fund, and 15% in a 2065 target date fund. Originally, all my contributions were going to the 2065 fund, but I shifted to a more aggressive strategy since I'm only 23.

I'm considering opening another account to invest in individual stocks, as I'm somewhat limited in my current 401k options. I can afford an additional $500 per month for this. However, I'm also debating whether it would be better to just increase my 401k contributions, considering the tax advantages.

What do you all think? Should I diversify with individual stocks, or focus on maximizing my 401k?

2. Don’t pick shit stocks stick with the best names.

4. Diversify. Everyone and their own way of doing this. Find which way works best for you.  
5. Don’t think about getting rich overnight, it takes years of DCA and scaling into a bigger portfolio and also where you will see best results(5-10+ years)
6. Always focus on maxing Roth IRA before brokerage. 
7. Why settle for the 2nd best when you can buy the best?(example; NVDA consistently outperformed AMD)
8. You should have less than 30(I have less than 10) stocks overall. You don’t want 300 stocks worth a few dollars, when you can have 10 or 30 worth a few thousand.

As a digital native I've worked a lot with Google's products and I've used google like everyone else to an extent where it is part of my everyday life. But now... Not so much. I have to admit - I'm finding myself searching very rarely. Yeah, I'm using maps and gmail and so on - but the moat on those businesses is not very high. My gut - as their core consumer - is telling me that I don't need google as much as I used to. And honestly, for the first time every where I've actively reflected on it - I totally can imagine a world without google.

So, I'm not so sure we are going back to an all dominant Google again, and instead of assuming that Google will be the mastodont forever, I can more rationally imagine a scenario where the business slowly adapts into niches over time. Think Kodak etc.

StockMarket,Newcomer stock & mobile app advice?,"Hello, I’m considering taking 5k from my 401k so I can play with the stocks a bit myself. Not much experience made some $ years back on the weed stocks. The stocks I was considering are GE, Nvidia, Google, and Tesla. Was going to maybe evenly contribute amongst these stocks. Any words of advice or stocks I should include/avoid? 
Short term return also applicable would consider selling and banking profits and leaving the initial 5k in the market.
One more thing, a good app for stock trading? I’ve used Robinhood a bit and love the layout. I’ve had fidelity before it just wasn’t as simplified. I don’t like Robinhood because the stuff they pulled during AMC GME & and I turned stock lending on with the accidental click of a button. Not something I’d like to have investments in.

StockMarket,Robinhood Legend is...ehh..,"Robinhood Legend is...ehh.

So I finally had the chance to login and unlocking Legend and although it is customizable (to an extent), it STILL lacks a variety of chart overlays and indicators.

I was sure that Robinhood would unload a ton of indicators that are found in other reading platforms, but it seems as though they thought the new interactive chart would be enough to carry it's weight on its own.

Nope. Not even close.

You're only allowed 4 indicators total and 6 overlays. 6 overlays are a bit much, however, 4 indicators doesn't do it justice. For me, I like to have the following indicators giving me information: TTM, W/R, AROON, CCI, & EFI.

W/R doesn't exist on Legend, nor does TTM, W/E, or EFI... bummer.

Additionally, I only use Pivot Points & 4 SMAs (10, 20, 50, & 200).

All in all, I don't believe Legend is worth it's own weight. You have more indicators and options on the mobile app... Which is crazy to me.

I'm a subscribed Finviz user so I'll continue to use that chart scheme versus Legend until serious changes are added to it.

Other than that, what are your thoughts on the new Legend.

Please don't argue on this thread or I'll just delete it or lock it. Be civil and exchange information that will help us all.

StockMarket,"An unusual problem: All the stocks I bought this year went instantly up, and I'm disappointed because I kept a lot of cash waiting for corrections, none of which happened. Now they are all expensive to me, I am stuck holding 50% in cash. I hate DCA.","All stocks are bought this year, since I started investing this year.

I bought Disney two months ago, practically at the bottom, for $90, expecting 25-30% growth in around a year, but now it's already at $115.

I bought United Airlines for $51 four months ago, practically right before the spike, now it's $90. At the same time bought Delta Airlines for 45$, now is 64$, but sold at 54$.

I bought Archer in May, at the bottom, for $3.20 now it's at $6.0. Even before the spike, I sold 70% of Archer shares, expecting to buy them for less later. Five days after the sale, they doubled. Bought Joby at the same time for 5.7, now is 7.1. I am convinced of the long-term success of these two companies.

Bought QQQ in March, now is 15% up and expensive. Planed to buy in November last year, but did not have the money. The most of the portfolio.

And now comes the most important thing, because of which I got pissed off:

In August bought RKLB at 5.7. Now: 23. And bought LUNR at 5.2, now: 14.

I was extremely convinced of the long-term success of RKLB and LUNR before I even heard there was a WSB subreddit and before I even heard they were popular stocks. That was my internal research unrelated to stock market trends. My plan was to buy them for long-term holding, at least 10 years. RKLB was my main planned investment. For LUNR, I wasn't so sure about the long-term success, but I certainly was for the short-term. I was 100% sure about RKLB. I wanted the best possible entry position. Bought RKLB for 5.7 and LUNR for 5.2. However, I only invested small percent of the planned sum, because I wanted to continue buying for less. I waited, waited, expecting some kind of correction, but after I bought them, they immediately went parabolic, and I was getting more and more angry and didn't want to buy until they fell significantly. They did not fall, but only went up. I even sold 30% of RKLB and LUNR at $11 and $8.1, expecting a correction so I could buy more shares for less. So I reduced the number of shares even more. Five days after the sale, this biggest spike followed. From 11 to 22, and from 8 to 14. While others can't wait to see their shares grow, I was pissed off with every movement up, because I was losing the chance to buy them at a lower price, and I certainly expected that success, just not this fast. Now I'm left with 50% of my money in cash, and only a total of 4% of my portfolio in RKLB and LUNR. So:

RKLB, LUNR, ACHR and Joby are for long term (QQQ included). The rest: until they recover.

The rest of portfolio (all bought last week) is: ASML, bought last week at 621e. (3% of portfolio), PDD Holdings and Baidu, bought couple days ago at 105$ and 82$ (total of 3.5% of portfolio). Also Google, bougt two days ago at 168$. I am planing Nike and Alibaba next days.

Also bought Planet Labs in August at the bootom for 2.1, now is 3.5. Sold at 2.3 because I was not sure in long-term success. Ten days after the sale went double.

Someone would say that I did very well, but I am extremely dissatisfied because the most important planned investments (RKLB, and then ACHR) got away from me, i.e. I only have 3 percent of the total portfolio in them, and only 6% in RKLB, ACHR, LUNR and Joby, which were my main long term targets.

StockMarket,Funding E-Trade account with Cash app,Has anybody successfully used this method to fund a brokerage account? I read somewhere that you could link an E-Trade debit card and use the instant transfer option to deposit funds into your account and that they would be immediately available to start trading with once it hit. Tried it last night with a small amount and to my surprise it worked. I then tried transferring a larger amount this morning and got a message saying “your bank declined this transaction” and to call them if I was having issues. Called earlier and was told that when you use Cash app to fund your account it’s “hit or miss” on whether it works or not and that they had no control over that so there wasn’t anything they could do on their end. They also mentioned something about Mastercard being the ones who were in control of the transaction and were the ones who decided if it was went through or not which didn’t make much sense to me. Trying to find out if anyone has had the same experience or if this works/has worked for you.

StockMarket,I’ve been covering $NVDA since 2011 when it was worth just $0.35 per share (post-split adjusted that is). AMA about its latest earnings report. ,"**Update: Looks like we ran into sitewide issue right when things got started, I'll be back at noon ET to try this again!**   
  
Hi! I’m Dan Howley, the tech editor at Yahoo Finance, and Nvidia has seemingly been at the forefront of virtually everything I’ve covered since ChatGPT hit the scene in 2022.

I’ve been covering the tech space for 13 years and tracking Nvidia for even longer. I built my first desktop PC with an Nvidia graphics card in high school and have continued using its products ever since.

Now I, like everyone else, am focused on Nvidia’s AI efforts, from reporting on how they’re dealing with [the threat of increased competition](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-rivals-are-circling-but-theyre-still-years-from-catching-up-211621835.html) to [attending the company’s GTC conference](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-debuts-next-generation-blackwell-ai-chip-at-gtc-2024-205825161.html) to chatting with [CEO Jensen Huang alongside my colleague Julie Hyman](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/demand-is-just-so-strong-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-tells-yahoo-finance-supply-cant-keep-up-012653951.html).

With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia’s chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like [AMD are gaining steam](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-debuts-latest-ai-chips-as-it-battles-rivals-nvidia-intel-180032426.html), and Nvidia’s own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant.

How that plays out over the next few years is anyone’s guess.

In today’s fiscal 2025 third quarter earnings report, Nvidia beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines on the strength of sales of its high-powered AI chips.

💵 Revenue: $35.08B vs  $33.2B expected  
💲 Adjusted EPS: $0.81 vs $0.74 expected  
💾 Data center revenue: $30.8B vs $29B expected

Nvidia also said it anticipates revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, for the fiscal fourth quarter. That's just ahead of Wall Street expectations of $37 billion.

I’ll be back tomorrow, Nov. 21, at 10 a.m. ET to answer your questions about Nvidia’s latest earnings, the market reaction, and where the stock goes from here.

StockMarket,"Doubt about [The Intelligent Investor]: Could this be an error?
","Chapter 2: The Investor and Inflation

\- Inflation and corporate earnings. (p. 51-52)

....""Our extended studies have led to the conclusion that the investor cannot count on much above the recent five-year rate earned on the DJIA group— about 10% on net tangible assets (book value) behind the shares. Since the market value of these issues is well above their book value—say, 900 market vs. 560 book in mid-1971—the earnings on current market price work out only at some 61⁄4%. (This relationship is generally expressed in the reverse, or “times earnings,” manner—e.g., that the DJIA price of 900 equals 18 times the actual earnings for the 12 months ended June 1971.)...""

It states that the market value of the stocks was 900, with an earnings yield of 6.25% (EPS = 56.25). Later, it mentions that this corresponds to a P/E ratio of 18 (""the DJIA price of 900 is equal to 18 times the actual earnings"").

However, when I calculate the P/E ratio, I get 16:

\\\[

\\text{P/E} = \\frac{\\text{Market Price}}{\\text{EPS}} = \\frac{900}{56.25} = 16

\\\]

So, I’m wondering:

1. Could the stated \*\*18\*\* in the book be an approximation or a rounded figure?
2. Or is there some other context or implicit calculation that justifies the value of 18?

Thanks in advance for any insights!",3,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1gwlgrt/doubt_about_the_intelligent_investor_could_this/,chapter investor inflation inflation corporate earnings p extended study led conclusion investor cannot count much recent fiveyear rate earned djia group net tangible asset book value behind share since market value issue well book valuesay market v book midthe earnings current market price work relationship generally expressed reverse time earnings mannereg djia price equal time actual earnings month ended june state market value stock earnings yield eps later mention corresponds pe ratio djia price equal time actual earnings however calculate pe ratio get textpe fractextmarket pricetexteps frac im wondering could stated book approximation rounded figure context implicit calculation justifies value thanks advance insight,-0.012499999999999997,Negative

PLEASE ask specific questions and PLEASE don’t ask about earnings because I typically don’t take positions before earnings announcements. Questions like “Thoughts on \_\_\_\_\_?” or “Why isn’t \_\_\_ on the watchlist?” or something answered already will be ignored unless you add detail and your opinion.

Questions like “Thoughts on \_\_\_\_\_?” or “Why isn’t \_\_\_ on the watchlist?” or something answered already will be ignored unless you add detail and your opinion.  If you post a question and delete it after I answer it, I will block you- doing that hurts discussion. I am not answering questions if I’m still long or short a stock beyond what I update.

Today looks to be the day that the market experiences some minor pullback. Largely watching the same momentum stocks I have for the past few days.

I am going to invest about $10,000.

How would you do it and where would you put it to receive high percentage dividends but also yield long term growth?

I have a “general” idea but any advice from all of you would be greatly appreciated.

Using Fidelity/RobinHood here’s my plan:

Dividend Stocks (50%): For consistent income.

ETFs: Considering ETFs like Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM) or iShares Select Dividend ETF (DVY) for diversified exposure.

Individual Stocks: Companies like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Procter & Gamble (PG), or Coca-Cola (KO) are known for reliable dividends.

Growth Stocks (30%): For high growth potential.

Technology (e.g., Apple, NVIDIA, Microsoft) or healthcare innovation.

ETFs: Growth-focused ETFs like ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) or Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG) provide diversified growth exposure.

Low-Risk Assets (20%): HY Savings Account

StockMarket,How to Hedge Against Inflation: Thoughts on the Incoming Administration,"I’ve been thinking a lot about the incoming administration’s potential impact on inflation and the economy. Many of Trump’s proposed policies strike me as inherently inflationary. Here are some key points I’ve been considering:

1. **Mass Deportation:**
   * Disrupting this workforce will almost certainly induce inflation by increasing labor shortages and raising wages in certain sectors.
2. **Tariffs:**
   * Tariffs are another concern. Even if Trump walks back some of his campaign promises, tariffs are still inflationary.
3. **Cutting Government Jobs/Spending:**
   * This is sure to create economic strain.

**The Big Question:** Given these potential policies, where should I position myself in an inflationary environment???

* **Equities:**
   * Equities are often considered a hedge against inflation because companies can pass costs on to consumers. Housing also tends to be a good hedge, as property values often keep pace with inflation. However, at what point does sustained inflation trigger an **economic crash** or a sharp market sell-off?
* **Cash:**
   * Cash seems like a losing proposition during inflationary times, as its purchasing power erodes. But could there be a moment when the market correction makes holding cash advantageous? Warren Buffet seems to think so.
* **Tech Stocks:**
   * Imo tech stocks, particularly B2B companies, might be less impacted by these inflationary pressures. They’re less reliant on cheap labor and less vulnerable to tariffs. If there’s a broad market sell-off, I’d expect the S&P to take a hit initially, but I think tech might see breakouts later as inflationary impacts stabilize.

So, what do you all think? Where would you position yourself? Are there other sectors or strategies I’m overlooking?

StockMarket,Which high growth stock went higher than previous day high?,"These are high quality growth stocks that's trading higher than 13 weeks ago and higher than 52 weeks ago and have growth rate greater than 10% AND these had higher close today than previous trading day. It shows strong momentum to the upside but still we have to do our due diligence before opening new positions. My indicators on chart are as follows: Green cloud is 200 sma, Brown cloud is 50ema and the other two moving averages I have are 9/21 ema. If the price is above all the moving averages, that shows strong momentum to the up. On the bottom I have EPS (Earnings Per Share) and GPE - Price/Earnings to Growth which is also called PEG ratio. A lower PEG ratio indicates the stock is *undervalued.* An undervalued stock with high EPS ratio is good for long term hold.

People are always concerned about how long until the recession hits, but I thought what about market tops related to yield curve un-inversion......and do I have some news for you.

Here it is in short:


10 year minus 2 year

Average market top is 101 days after un-inversion. We are at 78 days!


10 year minus 3 month

Average market top is only 14 days after un-inversion.
It should un-invert next week!

I was wondering if some people do that with stock. We know there’s a lot of algorithms that automatically trade stocks on the market by gathering online data to make decisions and take actions. Anyone has tried to make a stock name or ticker appear  everywhere by creating users on socials media that start talking about the stock pushing it further? We hear everywhere about fake news on war in Ukraine pushing the desired narrative with fake account cheering for one camp or another. Maybe the same is happening around hand picked stocks that a small group tries to push to the sky. Anyone has seen such attempts or participated in such attempts?

StockMarket,"Waymo opens robotaxi service to anyone in Los Angeles, marking its largest expansion yet","Waymo, Alphabet’s autonomous vehicle subsidiary, has expanded its robotaxi service across nearly 80 square miles of Los Angeles, marking its largest rollout yet. Starting Tuesday, Angelenos can use the Waymo One app to hail a self-driving taxi throughout the city, a significant step after over 300,000 residents joined the waitlist. This expansion makes LA the third major city with Waymo's robotaxi service, following Phoenix and San Francisco.

The company’s rapid growth has been fueled by a recent $5.6 billion funding round, led by Alphabet with contributions from Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, and others. Currently, Waymo handles over 150,000 weekly rides across its markets, up from 100,000 in August. Waymo has also announced plans to launch in Austin, Texas, by 2025 and recently partnered with Hyundai to include the Ioniq 5 in its fleet, enhancing its lineup with vehicles equipped with custom sensors and AI “drivers.”

StockMarket,Stock market data help,"Hi everybody. I'm an economics student, and I'm currently writing my thesis on the effects of the U.S.-China trade war on the South Korean semiconductor industry. To make this analysis, I will look at the stock price fluctuations of SK semiconductor companies after certain tariff announcements. 

When I started working on my thesis in summer, I was able to download the historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance, and I have done so for many companies. Now that I'm working on my thesis again (deadline is in December) I want to add more companies to my list so I can make a generalizable analysis, however downloading the historical data on Yahoo is now behind a paywall so I will have to get the data elsewhere...

Does anyone know where I can **download historical data as a csv file**, preferably for free, or at least not as expensive as the $50/month Gold membership required to download from Yahoo? I would need data spanning multiple years.

I've come across some trading websites, but a lot of them only allow downloads for a year worth of data. As I said I'm willing to pay but it's hard for me to distinguish between these websites and know which ones are trustworthy as I'm not a part of the stock market / trading community.

StockMarket,Netflix ad-supported tier has 70 million monthly users two years after launch,"Netflix's ad-supported tier has gained significant traction, reaching 70 million monthly users globally two years after its launch in November 2022. The tier, introduced as a response to slowing subscriber growth, has become a popular choice, with over 50% of new sign-ups opting for the ad-supported plan in countries where it's available. Netflix credits this tier with helping boost membership numbers, reporting 282.7 million total subscribers across all pricing options last quarter.

The company is also seeing success with its advertising inventory, having sold out for two live NFL games on Christmas Day, a result of its three-year deal with the NFL. Advertisers like FanDuel, which will be the exclusive pregame sportsbook partner, and Verizon are lined up for the games. Netflix’s focus on ad-supported growth aligns with a broader industry shift towards affordable, ad-driven streaming options, as media companies seek new revenue streams in an increasingly competitive landscape. Starting next year, Netflix plans to pivot its performance reporting from subscriber numbers to revenue and other financial metrics, signaling a new phase in its growth strategy.

If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. 

Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions. I use IBKR TWS for my platform and charts. I am targeting potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. This means the potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, not the business, long-term prospects, or the people involved. 

PLEASE ask specific questions and PLEASE don’t ask about earnings because I typically don’t take positions before earnings announcements. Questions like “Thoughts on \_\_\_\_\_?” or “Why isn’t \_\_\_ on the watchlist?” or something answered already will be ignored unless you add detail and your opinion.  If you post a question and delete it after I answer it, I will block you- doing that hurts discussion. I am not answering questions if I’m still long or short a stock beyond what I update.

StockMarket,Hypothetical question about LTCG,"So I I've recently seen some information about LTCG tax and federal employees that if they fall in the right bracket pay 0%. Is this true regardless of federal employment?

So onto the core question.

Let's say you're an individual who's shares are equal to billions of dollars. If you wanted to make those liquid you'd have to sell and pay a tax if I understand correctly.

So what if you worked in some capacity for the U.S. federal government and if done correctly you could dump shares and make billions of dollars liquid and pay 0% or as low of a tax as possible. 
Does this seem logical or am I missing something.

Thanks.",0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1gpkr1f/hypothetical_question_about_ltcg/,ive recently seen information ltcg tax federal employee fall right bracket pay true regardless federal employment onto core question let say youre individual who share equal billion dollar wanted make liquid youd sell pay tax understand correctly worked capacity u federal government done correctly could dump share make billion dollar liquid pay low tax possible seem logical missing something thanks,0.08857142857142856,Positive

StockMarket,These are the stocks on my watchlist (11/11),"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader.

This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I only hold some/all MAG 7 stocks and market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions. I use IBKR TWS for my platform and charts.

I am targeting potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. This means the potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, not the business, long-term prospects, or the people involved.

PLEASE ask specific questions and PLEASE don’t ask about earnings because I typically don’t take positions before earnings announcements. Questions like “Thoughts on \_\_\_\_\_?” or “Why isn’t \_\_\_ on the watchlist?” or something answered already will be ignored unless you add detail and your opinion. 

 If you post a question and delete it after I answer it, I will block you- doing that hurts discussion. I am not answering questions if I’m still long or short a stock beyond what I update.

StockMarket,"Best ""turnaround"" stories in the market
","There are a few turnaround stories that appear to be going according to plan (Starbucks, $SBUX) and a few that aren't (Boeing, $BA). Whatever your view may be on a company, what are some companies/stocks that are currently in ""turnaround"" mode? Whether that be new leadership, updated product lines, or fresh culture.

I find it interesting to study, track, and ultimately research these companies to find things that work(ed). For example, I have kept up with the never-ending Boeing ($BA) saga of consistently defective quality. But the one thing that BA has going for it is that America *needs* Boeing, and given there's a duopoly of planes in the world (Boeing and Airbus), America is evermore invested and interested in Boeing survival.

Would love some additional companies to add to my radar in 'rebuilding' or 'turnaround' mode.",1,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1gp5eso/best_turnaround_stories_in_the_market/,turnaround story appear going according plan starbucks sbux arent boeing ba whatever view may company companiesstocks currently turnaround mode whether new leadership updated product line fresh culture find interesting study track ultimately research company find thing worked example kept neverending boeing ba saga consistently defective quality one thing ba going america need boeing given there duopoly plane world boeing airbus america evermore invested interested boeing survival would love additional company add radar rebuilding turnaround mode,0.24204545454545454,Positive
StockMarket,Give your opinion on my DCF analysis on different companies,"I've done a Google Sheets table where I do valuation on different companies so that I am able to get to the intrinsic value. I use the TTM Free Cash Flow and project its growth. The assumptions required are Free Cash Flow growth for 2024-2032, discount rate which takes into account time value of money and risk, perpetual growth which means FCF growth after 2032 and lastly I get the intrinsic value. I'll show my table with it's assumptions so you can tell me whether they should realistic or I should adjust some variable to be more realistic. I understand that these assumptions are optimistic but I am also optimistic about the companies so the numbers make sense to me. Discount rate is always 7.75% and Perpetual 3% so I'll just show my assumptions on FCF Growth for 2024-2032 and Intrinsic Value/DCF Price and the current price.

* **BAC** \- Crossed over resistance of 44.26 and retested that level. It should keep going higher under lower interest rate environment. My immediate target (resistance) is at 47.24
* **MSFT** \- Good stock to go/stay longs. Unlike many other stocks that's hitting ATH, MSFT still hasn't flown away to hit the ATH. It's not the question IF, the question is WHEN. Immediate resistance is at 438/439.
* **UPST** \- Upstart had great earnings and the stock went up by 24% in a day after earnings. The next immediate resistance is sitting between 86-95
* **META** \- Meta is going in a range at this point. The support is sitting at 558-569 and price coming to that area will be nicely bought.
* **INTC** \- Intel had nice weekly bullish candle. There are few pivot (support) levels: 24.71, 23.56, 22.12. My immediate target is at 27.86 where it can face some resistance.
* **AAPL** \- Apple has been going in a range. We need to look for a breakout/down. A close below 213 is a breakdown whereas close above 238 in daily chart will be a breakout.
* **AMZN** \- Amazon had a breakout above 200. Will it retest or continue going higher? My target to above sits at 214 for now.
* **AMD** \- Lot of people are looking at AMD. It had a bullish last week but I believe it still has some more room below before rallying.
* **SOFI** \- Nice weekly breakout. Do not chase and wait for retest. The key level to retest is at 11/12 range.

StockMarket,AG Mortgage (MITT),"my average position was around $14-$15 with a total return around (-$225~-$250) Now it’s $1.58 with the same amount of shares (so no split) at +$188.

Any reason why this went from a negative return to a positive overnight?

This was a junk transaction I made a few years back that I was gonna sell sometime this year to offset some taxes but apparently not any longer. 

I don’t actively invest currently, it was a phase during Covid.

StockMarket,I'm extremely bullish on TSLA. ,"I just had hand surgery so I'm writing this one-handed, but during my recovery I did nothing but look at TSLA charts. I've never been a big believer of technical analysis and I know some people ride and die for support levels but honestly I find it can be quite distracting and not very useful. In this case, however, we can notice a pattern of bag holders who have FOMO'd into something they've wanted to sell for a quick buck and then had to bear the pain sometimes for years. A good deal of those sold at a loss at some point but TSLA's Market Cap is still made up in some part of people in the red. These people have been waiting to cash in for years and at this point they're not gonna sell unless it at least hits a historic high. So I do believe that a price of $400 is, at least for now, an important support level for this stock, and if I know the dude-bro culture that is largely responsible of this rally, I'd actually say $420 is an ever more reasonable price within the next 2 months.

StockMarket,When is a person too tech heavy?,"So I was always interested in investing and I recently invested 1000€ through IBKR.

I put 2/3 of that money in CSPX and 1/3 in IUIT.

I have 6000€ more to invest any I’m planning on putting some of that money in individual stocks. AAPL, MSFT and NVDA are already 50% of IUIT so I don’t think that I need more of them but I’m planning to put 5% in GOOGL and AMZN each.

StockMarket,"Passive Investing: Benefits, Challenges, and the Hybrid Approach","This is a long one, so I made interim summaries to keep the main points clear.

I'm working on a quant model aimed at outperforming the SPY at similar risk levels. The motivation behind this is the challenge of choosing the right passive products and the fact that most managed portfolios have underperformed the SPY.

Would love to hear your thoughts on the hybrid model I’m working on or any experience you’ve had with quant models.

Thanks!

**So, let's start...**  
  
The meteoric rise in popularity of the passive investment approach is overall a positive trend for retail investors. However, there’s one critical point I’d like to emphasize—there’s no such thing as truly passive investing. At least, not in an absolute sense. So, after dropping that bombshell, let me dive into the details.

# Passive Investing

The passive investment approach is based on studies showing that the chances of outperforming the benchmark or market return through active portfolio management are notably low. Yes, some fund managers manage to beat the index, and they often make headlines. But studies reveal that a manager who has beaten their chosen benchmark doesn’t necessarily keep outperforming it consistently.

So, a manager might have a good year, or even a few. But in the long run—this is the key point—it just doesn’t work. Another aspect of these studies is that even if a skilled manager can beat the benchmark, the likelihood of investors finding and choosing that manager among all others is, in itself, quite low.

**Interim Summary:** *Fund managers don’t consistently beat the index, and investors don’t consistently pick the managers who do.*

# Passive Investment Products

The widespread success and understanding of passive investing benefits are visible in the huge range of passive investment products. This vast supply reflects high demand but also creates complexity, which I’ll highlight further.

Passive products, like index-tracking ETFs, are diversified, have low management fees, and enable investors to follow indexes or groups of stocks based on common themes like blockchain, electric vehicles, robotics, cannabis, and more.

As of August 2024, nearly 3,500 ETFs trade on Wall Street, most of them passively managed. Their numbers grow at an impressive double-digit rate year-over-year. But as I previously mentioned, this impressive supply adds complexity, effectively introducing active elements into the passive approach.

# The Small and Medium problems of Passive Investing

While studies highlight the effectiveness of the passive approach, it’s particularly efficient over the long term, with research recommending at least a 15-year period. Here’s why:

* In 2008, the S&P 500 fell by 50% during the subprime crisis.
* In 2018, the S&P dropped 20% between September and October.
* At the start of 2020, amid the COVID-19 outbreak, the S&P lost 34% in just a few weeks.
* In 2022, the S&P completed a 27% decline from its peak.

**Don’t get me wrong—I’m a proponent of passive investing**. But it’s crucial to grasp this long-term factor. Index investing is risky, even over the long term. The risk remains constant year after year, but the ability to recover from declines is the game-changer in passive investing—the long-term horizon is essential.

**Interim Summary:** *Passive investments are effective over the long term, yet most investors struggle to commit to this time frame, and in any case, the choices of tracked index and tracking product are active decisions.*

# Macro and Micro Risks

Investment risks can be simplified into two categories—macro and micro risks. Looking at passive investing through a risk lens can clarify why it’s so efficient. Essentially, with passive products (index-tracking investments), we neutralize micro risks, as broad diversification protects us from risks associated with specific companies.

Conversely, macro risks persist even in passive investments. Passive investing counters macro risks by relying on the investment horizon—the longer the time frame, the greater the ability to recover from downturns.

**Interim Summary:** *Passive investing uniquely addresses both micro and macro risks. In contrast, active investing is exposed to both types of risks and tries to mitigate them through research and forecasting. As we’ve seen, most managers fail to manage these risks effectively and lag behind the indexes over time.*

# The Hybrid Investment Approach – Something Different

Taking a middle path, Hybrid Invest uses passive instruments exclusively, neutralizing micro risks like passive investing. Here, hybrid management comes into play, combining active and passive approaches.

In a nutshell, the hybrid investment approach focuses solely on macro risk analysis, using a fixed formula or quantitative model that is unaffected by investor psychology. The result is a portfolio aligned with macroeconomic trends. The implementation remains passive—the portfolio consists of highly liquid, central ETFs. Unlike the active approach, it disregards the microeconomic environment, focusing on index-tracking products.

**Let's revisit the large and small asterisks of passive investing. It’s clear that the hybrid approach addresses both in two ways: (1) adaptation to the macroeconomic environment reduces reliance on the investment horizon, and (2) it offers an active element in selecting the index-tracking product at the core of the passive approach.**

For example, I am 30 and when I try to talk to my friends about investing or getting them to invest it always goes in one ear and out the other or they think there is no point. These same people will complain about the economy and gas/grocery prices etc. and when you try to tell them thats the whole point of why you need to be investing they just don’t believe it or think it only benefits “rich” people. Now i get it home prices are insane and a real problem, but had I not started investing from 2019 instead of saying “there is no point” and just complained the whole time I would not have the 20k extra from the market gains apart from my contributions I made in my non retirement account from 2019 up until now. I literally used to doordash for three years with my Honda civic and only made about 20-25k net doing that eventually got a low level call center role at a brokerage firm where i was able to increase investing even more and am in a lot better place financially because of it, hell it has even helped my lifelong depression.

Money DOES NOT cure depression or make us happy, but it has made it a little better as I have been diagnosed with major depression since a child. And honestly just like eating more healthy investing has helped in a way as anyone who deals with depression knows there is no cure really but I have found investing has helped me a lot not only by providing more stability but as a way to distract my mind and read about it etc. 

Anyways, I say all of this to just see has anyone else’s experience been similar to where you see people struggling etc and maybe they don’t have ideal jobs, but they still choose to complain or blame politics for their suffering? I mean like I said I literally was a doordash driver for 3 years out of college due to covid and weak job market at that time for my studies fresh out of college and still found a way to put some money back I don’t get it. Even if its only 20 dollars a week 20 dollars a week compounded is still better than 0 5-10 years down the road.

Im just not buying all of the complaining I see all over social media. I see plenty of the MAGA types complaining just as much as I see the plenty other democrats complain as well. I just feel blessed to kind of not be blinded I guess and found out about investing early on in life and actually believed in it.

StockMarket,Tips for beginners ,"Good evening everyone, I'll be brief here

I'm from Brazil and with the announcement of the election results in the US, our currency has depreciated more than it already was

In the coming years I will seek to protect my assets from Brazilian fiscal irresponsibility by buying and investing in dollars (even if it is a little costly for me because of the exchange rate)

I have an account with a Brazilian investment brokerage that allows me to access the American market and stock exchange and if I don't do it now, in about 2 years, it will be very difficult economically for us

In Brazil, I work in a restaurant and I manage to save money each month, which I use to invest in the Brazilian stock market and buy dollars at the same time (I don't only have my work as a source of income)

I would really like someone more experienced (especially if they are from the US) to help me on this journey

On the positive side, Volkswagen's investment in RIVN seems solid, and it looks like exactly the kind of European business involvement Trump wants to see in the US market. But here's what's bugging me - could Musk's influence on Trump's policies create an uneven playing field for emerging EV brands?

Some points to consider:
- Rivian's growing production numbers and improving margins
- VW's commitment to the US market through RIVN
- Tesla's dominant position and Musk's political connections
- Potential policy changes affecting EV subsidies

This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I only hold some/all **MAG 7** stocks and market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions. I use **IBKR TWS** for my platform and charts.

I am targeting potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. This means the potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, not the business, long-term prospects, or the people involved.

PLEASE ask specific questions and PLEASE don’t ask about earnings because I typically don’t take positions before earnings announcements. Questions like “Thoughts on \_\_\_\_\_?” or “Why isn’t \_\_\_ on the watchlist?” or something answered already will be ignored unless you add detail and your opinion. If you post a question and delete it after I answer it, I will block you - doing that hurts discussion. I am not answering questions if I’m still long or short a stock beyond what I update.

StockMarket,"Trump Election, How to Play","Stocks to be bullish on during a Trump term:

Oil: $XOP, $XOM, $SHEL, $MRO

C*****: $COIN, $MARA, $WULF

Big Bois - Apple: $MSFT, $NVDA, $AMZN etc

Military: $BA, $LMT, $RTX

Prison: CoreCivic ($CXW)

Sectors to be bearish on during a Trump term:

All renewable energy (except maybe nuclear)

Agriculture: immigrants make up significant amount of (cheap) labor for the sector

International shipping: tariffs and isolationist policy would be bad

Auto-manufacturing: parts coming from overseas will have tariffs

Low cost foreign retail like Shein and Temu equivalents will get hit hard by tariffs

⚠️Increased Volatility: Awaiting Action⚠️

Cannabis: Republicans have historically been tough on marijuana. It seemed like things would be par for the course once again until Trump said on Truth Social that he would be voting in favor of Amendment 3 in Florida which would make it completely legal for adults 21 and up. I suspect this was a grift, but he’s such a wildcard that maybe he really would go against the conservative grain.

$APPL: While I left it out of the Big Bois due to the China taxes being a bearish variable, I think it should still hold strong in the long term.  We’ll see

$TSM probably has the widest range of outcomes in the market imo. 
If Trump’s attitude toward China is legit-

Best Pro: $TSM sees increased demand from U.S. and allies who want to bypass China’s questionable supply chain.

Worst Con: $TSM still makes most of their money from China, who could retaliate in a number of ways

Least worst con: $TSM is still intertwined with China’s cheaper supply chain. A western supply chain would be more expensive and be time consuming to adopt.

Don’t even want to consider it possible, but anything less diplomatic than economic warfare with China would be drastic not only for $TSM but for the people of Taiwan, god forbid.

$DJT + $TSLA: boy oh boy🤢
Ironically, both of these companies are suffering from the same problem and are presenting the same solution.

Solution: present people with a charismatic rich guy in hopes they will buy/use the product off of pure Ethos alone.

\#TSLA is definitely carrying the returns even though it's only 5% of my portfolio.

Being the single largest donor to Trump's campaign is working out for Elon (and me).

What surprised me, though, is seeing other stocks like Coca-Cola (KO) and some REITs reacting negatively, dropping by about -4%. It makes me wonder why certain sectors seem to be moving in the opposite direction. 

It looks like today’s heatmap is showing a clear trend: sectors like consumer non-durables and health tech took a noticeable hit, while finance and tech stocks are up. Interesting to see how varied the reactions are across sectors—maybe it’s tied to post-election sentiments or a shift in investor focus? Anyone else noticing similar patterns in their portfolio?

For example, let's say I create the company Tesco and eventually I go public on the stockmarket and then I keep 51% of shares, but the rest go on the stock market at £10 a share. The total number of shares at 100% is 1,000,000. 40% of the 49% are bought immediately and around 9% remains unsold at all times.

Now, as the company owner I get £4,000,000 private cash (assume no fees) and then retain 51% of all future profits. I pocket the cash and don't invest any of this into the company as it already has it's own healthy cash flow.

Anyway, let's say in 3 months time the profit is overstated (Like Tesco did in 2014) and the share price drops from £10 per share to £8. The same strangers that own the 40% of shares will still get the actual profit (from dividends) they would have got anyway, as the share price doesn't affect profit earned. Sure, their ROI on the actual share itself is affected, but only if they sell the share at the reduced price.


...if you don't sell and didn't plan on selling, then you are unaffected, no?

Clearly I am wrong though, as Tesco was heavily fined billions for something like this.

*(NOTE: Completely new to shares, have only ever bought shares before to hold and get dividends on an app, I know nothing more.

StockMarket,Merck: Large Value Company Currently Undervalued,"# My Investment Thesis:

A strong lineup of important drugs and vaccines, including Keytruda for cancer and Gardasil for HPV prevention. Merck’s strengths come from its solid patents, high spending on research, and valuable partnerships. Reliable income, supported by demand in both human and animal health, gives it a steady cash flow, which is used to grow and reward shareholders.

The company is focused on leading areas like cancer and immunotherapy, which keeps it aligned with current trends in healthcare. Keytruda, its top drug, is now approved for over 40 types of cancer in the U.S., showing its strong position in this market. The company’s future looks promising, with new drugs in late-stage trials and partnerships with firms like Moderna and Daiichi Sankyo to develop new treatments. Although challenges like pricing rules and patent losses are expected, Merck’s focus on early-stage treatments and personalized medicine shows it is planning for long-term steady growth.

The stock is trading at just 10.70 times its forward earnings and mostly below its 5-year averages. High Earnings Yield. Based on my Fair Price estimate, is undervalued by more than 30%. Other analysts are also positive-looking. If you are looking for a stable healthcare investment with steady growth potential, worth noting.

# My Fair Price Estimate:

[Author's Fair Price Estimate](https://preview.redd.it/ed5tovujx1zd1.png?width=1774&format=png&auto=webp&s=39249c2b0404a8dd3b50fc73ae8711560c6faa27)

I used:

* Discount Rate: 12% *(S&P 500 Next 5-Yr Growth Estimates is 11.04%)*
* Margin of Safety: 30%
* Years: 5
* Future EPS Growth Rate: 7% *(I will explain below)*
* Future Dividend and Buyback Yield: 3% *(I will explain below)*
* Total Future Annual Growth Rate: 7 + 3 = 10%

The expected YoY EPS growth for FY 2024 is projected to be significantly higher (see the image below) compared to FY 2023, but it is anticipated to stabilize in the following years. As mentioned in the Future section, the global pharmaceutical market is projected to have a CAGR of 7.7% through 2030. Initially, I set this figure at 8%, but I revised it to 7% due to Merck being a large value stock with potential future challenges, which we discussed in the Disadvantages section. Therefore, I believe 7% is a reasonable estimate for our analysis.

The average buyback and dividend yield is 3.46%, but for Merck, I decided to lower this figure to 3%. The reason is similar: Merck is a large-cap stock that may face potential issues in the future and increased competition. Consequently, I aimed for a final total future growth rate of 10% 😉

For the Bull Case, I used a future exit P/E of 24, which is based on the company's five-year average. In the Bear Case, I selected the lowest P/E ratio from the last few years, which was 18. For the Base Case, I took the midpoint between the Bull and Bear Cases, resulting in a value of 21. Notably, 21 is also their current P/E ratio.

I would like to compare my valuation with the opinions of other analysts to see what they think. In fact, I already did it in the Future section, but from a different perspective and a different resource.

StockMarket,Why Donald Trump’s Return Could Boost Demand for Robots – A Long-Term Investment Opportunity,"Hey everyone,

With Donald Trump making a return, I think there’s more to consider than just the political drama. Specifically, his policies could have a huge ripple effect on the labor market, especially in the service industry. Trump’s stance on illegal immigration means we could see a stronger push to reduce undocumented workers, which would lead to an even bigger labor shortage in industries like hospitality, food service, and logistics. If fewer workers are available, companies will likely have to fill that gap—and robots could be the answer.

That’s where robotics companies come in, especially ones like Tesla, Richtech Robotics (RR), and Serve Robotics. Tesla is aiming to make waves with its humanoid robots, while Serve Robotics focuses on last-mile delivery solutions in urban areas. But let’s talk about Richtech Robotics (RR) in particular because they’ve already got robots deployed and working in real-world environments, addressing exactly the kind of labor shortages we’re talking about. RR’s service robots are already in use across various industries, from restaurants to healthcare facilities, and they’re receiving high praise from clients for their reliability and efficiency. Their tech isn’t just conceptual—it’s been tested and proven, which gives them a solid foothold as demand grows.

And then there’s Elon Musk himself. If he ends up being involved in government restructuring, it wouldn’t be surprising to see him push for more automation within federal jobs too, given his passion for robotics and AI. If Musk advocates for more robots in both private and public sectors, we could see a huge surge in the robotics industry overall.

Sure, the attention is still on DJT stocks and virtual currency as short-term plays riding the Trump wave, but I see robotics as a sector with way more potential for sustainable growth. For those of us looking for long-term positions, robots could be the steady play we’re after, especially as the tech gets better and companies like RR, SERV continue proving their value in real-world applications.

Anyone else seeing this as a big moment to get into robotics stocks for the long haul?",0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1gkxve8/why_donald_trumps_return_could_boost_demand_for/,hey everyone donald trump making return think there consider political drama specifically policy could huge ripple effect labor market especially service industry trump stance illegal immigration mean could see stronger push reduce undocumented worker would lead even bigger labor shortage industry like hospitality food service logistics fewer worker available company likely fill gapand robot could answer thats robotics company come especially one like tesla richtech robotics rr serve robotics tesla aiming make wave humanoid robot serve robotics focus lastmile delivery solution urban area let talk richtech robotics rr particular theyve already got robot deployed working realworld environment addressing exactly kind labor shortage talking rrs service robot already use across various industry restaurant healthcare facility theyre receiving high praise client reliability efficiency tech isnt conceptualits tested proven give solid foothold demand grows there elon musk end involved government restructuring wouldnt surprising see push automation within federal job given passion robotics ai musk advocate robot private public sector could see huge surge robotics industry overall sure attention still djt stock virtual currency shortterm play riding trump wave see robotics sector way potential sustainable growth u looking longterm position robot could steady play especially tech get better company like rr serv continue proving value realworld application anyone else seeing big moment get robotics stock long haul,0.11595679012345679,Positive

**Summary:**

* PACS Group allegedly exploited COVID-era waivers to inflate Medicare revenue by claiming skilled care needs for COVID-exposed patients, significantly boosting profitability.
* Hindenburg's investigation reveals PACS generated over 100% of its 2020-2023 operating income from these schemes, enabling a lucrative IPO in 2024.
* Former employees allege PACS engaged in aggressive billing tactics, including Medicare Part B claims for unnecessary respiratory and sensory therapies.
* PACS purportedly misrepresented facility quality metrics to mislead shareholders, with only 29% of its facilities meeting high CMS ratings.
* The investigation details further regulatory evasion, including ""renting"" administrator licenses to operate multiple facilities beyond legal limits.

Stock currently down 37%.

**Quick dissection of the chart-** $35 is the short if you aren't fast enough to get first prints, because we make new lows.

StockMarket,Australian new to the Stock Market HELP?,"Hello everyone,

So I'm 30 and just got into the Stock Market, wish I did sooner but I'm in now

I was wondering if anyone has any tips of Stocks for me to look at particularly EFT

I have about $80-100K to invest and am aiming for growth to turn my first 100K into a million in the future I am happy to wait patiently rather than taking any unnessary risks but its very overwhelming at the moment even though I am studying hard there is so much information to find

I invested about $3K into CSL Ltd

$10K into the NASDAQ 100 ETF

$10K into the Vanguard Australian Shares Index ETF 

I plan to invest a further $20K into IVV ETF tomorrow and then continue to put 90% of my Portfolio into the IVV and I am also going to invest in the MVB as well

Does this plan make sense? I ask because I was about to wait until the New York Stock Exchange opened tonight to invest in the S&P 500 because I did not realise Tax would be more complicated and the IVV was practically the same thing but sold on the ASX to not complicate taxes etc

I am nervous because if I did not have a friend of a friend in Stocks that advised me not to do this I likely would have done it and luckily asked first, I do not want to make any further mistakes and was hoping some people could look at my plan and tell me if I am doing okay so far

Today was my first day of trading also and I made $50 profit on $20,000 in Investments is this normal or did I just get lucky? All my investments made money 

If you made it this far appreciate you reading and hope to hear some of your advice I only have 100K for stocks and I want to make it count

I joined the Stock Market on IG two days ago and I am panicking because I think I went too hard too soon, I deposited $44-$43,000 with the intention of Depositing $100k as soon as possible but I am letting the $44k sit there until I learn much more about the Stock Market before I do anything else.

I plan to put the rest into IVV once I learn more about the Stock Market but I lost $70 today and I am worried I bought in at a bad time and am just panicking because everyone is saying I bought in too soon and I should learn more beforehand and stuff and I am getting worried I am going to lose my Savings I planned to invest all of my $100k but I think now I am going to something I learned called ""Cost Dollar Averaging"" instead

Which from my understanding is just buying in slowly so the possible bear and bull trends do not effect when you as much in comparison to buying in all at once (I may have not understood cost dollar averaging well though)

StockMarket,Educate me about stock ,"So, what happens to your stock when a company is split/broken up?

It looks to me like its best to sell before the break up is announced, definitely before the split, but maybe I'm wrong?   
It's assets are shrinking, right? its net worth should be split... no? 

Ugh, there's a character limit.   
I'll fill that with a story. So I've followed stock loosely over the years... some of the best deals I've seen were almost always Elon musk deals. I was actually there for the solar city merger... sadly didn't have seed money. I knew it was going to be an excellent deal but couldn't capitulate.   
also was there at the twitter purchased, where they locked in at a higher price than the stock was when he purchased. can you imagine? Grabbing tesla stock at 25 dollars a stock? it was an incredible deal.   
  
so you could have purchased it and then picked up a 10 dollar earning per stock... easy peasy. Elon has always been good money so far. 

I also was there when the game stop thing happen, again no seed money... and doge... and I also called it when it was time to sell gamestop (yes, I know, everyone was screaming hold to hold because screw wall street... but us hustlers were pushing the line for the hold bros, so you can hate it but it helped the cause. moot point, I was on the call but didnt have any action behind it).

StockMarket,Fed Rate Cuts⬇️ But Yields⬆️,"When the Fed cuts rates, it typically signals an effort to stimulate the economy by making borrowing cheaper. However, if yields on Treasury bonds are rising despite rate cuts, it can suggest a few key dynamics in a healthy economy:

	1.	Increased Inflation Expectations: If investors expect inflation to rise, they may demand higher yields on bonds to offset the potential loss of purchasing power over time. In a healthy economy, inflation can increase as demand strengthens, leading to higher yields despite lower interest rates.
	2.	Expectations of Economic Growth: Rising yields could reflect market confidence in continued economic growth. Investors might believe that the Fed’s rate cuts will successfully support growth, and as a result, they anticipate stronger economic performance. This confidence could lead to higher yields, as investors shift to riskier assets like stocks, causing bond prices to fall and yields to rise.
	3.	Supply and Demand for Bonds: If the government increases its bond issuance to fund spending, the increased supply can drive up yields. In a healthy economy, more issuance might be expected to support expansionary policies, pushing yields higher.
	4.	Global Investment Shifts: Investors may be looking for higher returns than those offered by low Fed rates, leading them to seek out riskier assets. This capital outflow from bonds can lead to lower bond prices and thus higher yields, even while rates are being cut.

In short, in a healthy economy, rising yields alongside Fed rate cuts might indicate that investors are confident in economic resilience, expecting both inflation and growth to rise, while seeking higher returns outside of traditionally safe assets like bonds.",22,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1gixs8c/fed_rate_cuts_but_yields/,fed cut rate typically signal effort stimulate economy making borrowing cheaper however yield treasury bond rising despite rate cut suggest key dynamic healthy economy increased inflation expectation investor expect inflation rise may demand higher yield bond offset potential loss purchasing power time healthy economy inflation increase demand strengthens leading higher yield despite lower interest rate expectation economic growth rising yield could reflect market confidence continued economic growth investor might believe fed rate cut successfully support growth result anticipate stronger economic performance confidence could lead higher yield investor shift riskier asset like stock causing bond price fall yield rise supply demand bond government increase bond issuance fund spending increased supply drive yield healthy economy issuance might expected support expansionary policy pushing yield higher global investment shift investor may looking higher return offered low fed rate leading seek riskier asset capital outflow bond lead lower bond price thus higher yield even rate cut short healthy economy rising yield alongside fed rate cut might indicate investor confident economic resilience expecting inflation growth rise seeking higher return outside traditionally safe asset like bond,0.22345679012345682,Positive

StockMarket,US Election 2024 - Market Considerations,"The Election is likely the dominant event determining what the market does for the next week or so. Here is how I am seeing it, and looking to play it. Looking forward to your thoughts and feedback!

To start with, there are not one, but two events related to the elections. The first is, of course, the **outcome** itself - who gets to play President, and how Congress goes. The second is how **contested** the process will be, if the losing party refuses to accept the results. Let’s take each in turn.

# 1. Playing the Outcome

Outcomes, in order of likelihood (my guesstimate), are:

* Red sweep (Trump wins, Reps control both House and Senate)
* Harris wins with split Congress (Dems control House, Reps control Senate)
* Trump wins with split Congress (Dems control House, Reps control Senate)
* Blue sweep (Harris wins, Dems control both House and Senate)

(The Senate has a 90% chance to be Red, while the House will likely go with the Presidential winner.)

Binary events like Elections allow us opportunities to generate alpha because probabilistic outcomes are resolved, and we can do well if we can divine which way the resolution will be. 

The consensus seems to be that a Trump win is being priced in, which I agree with. Based on how various sectors have reacted as poll outcomes and betting market odds have changed. 

# 1.1 Immediate Aftermath

If you agree that that is the priced-in outcome, then we can anticipate responses accordingly when the outcome is known. Specifically, this is my mental map of what the market might do **immediately** (the hours …) after the results are known:

* Red sweep: market **green** \- everything markets have been pricing in are priced in even more.
* Harris wins with split Congress: market **red**, but not violently so as a split Congress will limit what she can get done.
* Trump wins with split Congress: markets meh to **slight red**, as this is basically what the market is pricing in now, and we could get a sell-the-news thing happen.
* Blue sweep: market **red**, maybe violently. 

Personally, I don’t see pricing that allows for efficient pre-positioning. Rather, will enter once there is confirmation. 

# 1.2 Longer Term Movement

Normally, after election results are known, the market tends to shoot up after the initial reaction from **vol crush**. I.e. binary event resolved, volatility associated with that dissipates.

This time is different because FOMC meetings are right after - on the 6th and 7th. And they are high stakes. So at least a decent chunk of that volatility will persist into Friday. 

This increases the likelihood that if the market gets red, it may stay red for a few days. Especially if we dip into **negative gamma** territory. And in case the market is green, it’ll remain capped by FOMC-driven vol.

Thus, we probably won’t fully internalize the Election result reaction function until Friday. (As opposed to the policy long-tail reaction function, which will take months.)

# 1.3 Sectors and Asset Classes

In addition to the entire market, we can prepare for reaction functions within sectors and asset classes. Here is how I see who is better/worse for which:

Sectors:

* **Tech:** Trump worse, given tariffs will hit semis and other Chinese imports, many of which are tech-related. 
* **Energy:** Trump better - drill, baby, drill. 
* **Financials:** Trump better - fewer regulations, more M&A, less antitrust.

(Non-equity) Asset Classes:

* **Long-term Bonds**: Both bad, but Trump worse. 
   * Harris will increase the deficit from profligate spending, but cover some of that with new taxes or canceled tax breaks. 
   * Trump will keep tax cuts, and cut more. Increase in tariffs and reduction in flow of labor will also increase inflation more, putting more pressure on long bonds.
* **Gold:** Both will be good for gold, as both will debase the dollar from all the deficits.
* **Crypto**: Trump better - more crypto-friendly.

Thus, I’m considering:

* Either wins: buy gold, short long bonds
* Trump wins: buy energy, financials, and crypto
* Harris wins: buy tech, short crypto

# 1.4 $DJT

No discussion of plays would be complete without referencing Trump’s eponymous “media company,” DJT (formerly DWAC).

Given the drop already, it’s now likely that a Trump win will give it a bump. Otherwise it would have been a strong case for sell-the-news.

However, this company has no redeeming companies, and so should eventually fall back to earth. 

Of course, everyone knows this, so IV is pretty jacked. That makes it difficult to start new plays, except perhaps ratio spreads/backspreads. I have some put ratio spreads on, betting on a sell-the-news for a few weeks after the Elections are over.

# 2. In case the elections are contested

In case Harris wins, Trump could contest the elections. Or some battleground States might end up being special snowflakes and not serve up their electoral votes in time. This creates the prospect of uncertainty, which market will price in as: **vol up, markets down**. 

While market is going down, I’ll:

* buy UVXY and UVXY calls
* buy long-dated VIX puts

When election results are resolved and VIX shows signs of bottoming, I’ll:

* buy SVIX 
* sell long-dated VIX calls
* buy LETFs like TQQQ and UPRO

Incidentally, options are pricing in an expected move of 2.6% or 151 points by Fri. This is something to keep an eye on to gauge how the markets are looking at the contested status.

# 3. The Longer Term

Once the Election- and FOMC-related movements have happened, we get into Santa-rally territory. There are two major drivers of this.

**First**, many fund managers have been under-performing, but also holding back as they don’t know which sectors will do better than others without knowing the election outcome. (See NAAIM exposure index.)

I expect them to flood in as they try to catch up into the end of the year, resulting in a glorious rally. 

**Second**, this market is well hedged. There’s a ton of puts that’s been bought (skew smile is quite extended!), and vol is high. Markets will only fall so much, as puts are monetized as market falls. And once the market stops falling and vol dissipates, de-hedging flows associated with puts going more OTM also add a tailwind to markets. 

Combined, this basically means if there is any more red in the market around elections (and FOMC), circumstances are also likely setting us up for a very nice BTFD opportunity.The Election is likely the dominant event determining what the market does for the next week or so.

In sum, big picture, I see next week as another opportunity to buy-the-dip.

StockMarket,GE- Physical stock  certificate,"
Hello /r/stockmarket.

My mother has 400 shares of GE stock on a physical stock certificate dated mar 5th, 2003. I recently took them to Schwab to get them digitally converted into her brokerage. How do they mathematically do all the calculations for what she has in today's value? I know GE has had a history of splits, reverse splits, and even splitting into 3 different companies with all differing valuations. Schwab said that this would take 1-2 weeks to sort, but the young guy at the desk said it is around 70,000$ at today’s valuation, which seems crazy. 

Does anyone have any estimate at how much my mother is looking at here once these shares show up into her brokerage?

StockMarket,20 Yrs old. Portfolio Update/Advice,"Hey guys so i’ve taken some advice from the last time i posted and decided to cut out google from my holdings because i’ve seen the impact that chatgpt has had especially through my experience on my college campus seeing the increased use. I’ve added PLTR before the induction into the S&P after carefully consideration and research I believe that it could be a great player in the future especially after reading about how effectively it reduces the time of underwriting at insurance companies from 2weeks to 2hours. I believe that other companies will eventually have to invest in their products and services, maybe not now, but certainly in the future and this isn’t including their military side. I’m iffy on holding NVIDIA because of how much hype it’s gotten this year but it’s hard to gage how much demand is needed , i have no problem holding for the next year but after that I might sell. I’ve added 6 more shares of CRWD because I genuinely think that bigger companies in this day and age cannot operate without Cybersecurity. The last company i worked at (Cigna) uses Crowd-strikes malware scan and in the midst of CRWDs downturn with delta etc i had a good feeling that it would recover. AMZ remains my biggest holding and i think it’s still so undervalued. I’d like to hear your guys perspectives on the balance of my portfolio.

StockMarket,Has anyone bought into Pete Buttigieg and his claim to create more charging stations for electric vehicles?,"I’ve recently watched interviews and listened to the state secretary Pete Buttigieg discuss his plans to create more charging stations for electric cars. I find it to be very realistic by 2030. He even made mentions of programs that help sponsor people to get said electric cars. Everyone always makes discussions of what to do to better the environment etc. I realize there will be ideologies who will either be for or against (perhaps even find the perspective to be stubborn or outrageous) but I still think it’s not a bad idea to consider and make investments into stocks that contribute towards this big goal he says he is working towards. What are all of your thoughts on this, if any? What stocks, if you’ve been invested into his discussion in this, have you considered worthy of long term investment? I’m not necessarily trying to say “tell me what to buy” but rather, what should people be reading on about this.

StockMarket,Is Apple at risk of overvaluation ,"We use the DCF model to value Apple. Apple's total debt of $100 billion is almost insignificant compared to its market capitalization of $3.5 trillion.

Based on consensus, revenue growth is expected to accelerate from single digits to 12.6% in FY 2027. Due to the issues I described above, I think this is a risky assumption.

StockMarket,(META) Rules Review - Portfolio Review Posts ,"Hi StockMarket users! 

We have recently noticed an increase in the number of posts that are requesting advice about portfolio allocations, next steps, etc. These posts tend to see decent engagement with helpful comments. On the other hand, we see that some users are complaining about these posts. The intent of this post is to collect community feedback on the ""Belongs in portfolio thread"" rule to better understand how the users of this subreddit would like to see this rule enforced. 

Despite being a fairly large sub, this sub has somewhat low user activity and post engagement. We are attempting to balance post volume with post quality. The mods of this subreddit have discussed this rule internally on multiple occasions. We would like to open the discussion up to the community to collect your thoughts. 

Would you like the mods to:

1. Remove the ""Belongs in Portfolio Thread"" rule and the stickied portfolio review thread
2. Remove low-effort portfolio review posts (e.g. image-only posts, allocation-only posts, etc.). Users are required to provide a minimum level of commentary explaining their portfolio allocation and strategy to help guide constructive answers.
3. Strictly enforce the portfolio review rule on any related posts. We're not here to review other people's portfolios.

StockMarket,Planning My Portfolio Based on Trump’s 2024 Policies – Seeking Insights,"Hey everyone! I’m looking to allocate £8,000 GBP into a diversified portfolio, with a focus on sectors that could benefit from Trump’s anticipated policies if he wins the 2024 elections. I’m planning to distribute the funds as follows:

* Oil & Energy: 40% (£3,200)
* Financials: 20% (£1,600)
* Infrastructure: 20% (£1,600)
* Pharmaceuticals: 10% (£800)
* Defense: 10% (£800)

I want to know your thoughts on this allocation and the expected holding periods. Here’s how I see each sector performing based on the potential policy landscape:

# Sector Analysis

1. Oil & Energy (40%)
   * Policy Impact: Expect relaxed regulations and support for domestic production.
   * Expected Movement: Prices might stabilize above $85/bbl due to strong demand.
   * Holding Period: 6–12 months. I’ll reassess performance and consider trailing stops to manage risks.
2. Financials (20%)
   * Policy Impact: Deregulation and tax incentives could boost profits.
   * Expected Movement: Positive rate trends could enhance lenders’ margins.
   * Holding Period: 6–12 months. Keeping an eye on rate changes and potential deregulation.
3. Infrastructure (20%)
   * Policy Impact: Anticipated federal spending could ramp up.
   * Expected Movement: Steady gains as contracts are awarded, but slow price appreciation due to timelines.
   * Holding Period: 12+ months. Longer-term investments due to project lead times.
4. Pharmaceuticals (10%)
   * Policy Impact: Stable, but potential pressure on pricing.
   * Expected Movement: Moderate growth, especially for firms with domestic incentives.
   * Holding Period: 6–12 months. I’ll watch for FDA developments and pricing policy discussions.
5. Defense (10%)
   * Policy Impact: Increased spending on military capabilities expected.
   * Expected Movement: Steady gains from expanded contracts.
   * Holding Period: 12+ months. Long-term due to multi-year contract commitments.

# Overall Strategy Thoughts

* Regular Rebalancing: I’ll keep a close watch on oil and leveraged ETFs, checking performance monthly or quarterly.
* Profit-Taking Strategy: Setting trailing stops to lock in gains, especially in volatile sectors like oil.
* Monitor Policy Changes: Staying updated on announcements to adapt my strategy accordingly.

Questions for Discussion:

1. What are your thoughts on the sector allocations? Any recommendations?
2. How do you see the oil market shaping up in the next 6-12 months?
3. Any advice on managing risk with ETFs in the financials, construction & defense sector?

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts! Thanks!

StockMarket,Dear everyone who is new and posting asking for advice. Read this before posting.,"[Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/?f=flair_name%3A%22Discussion%22)

# The quality of information you receive when you ask a question is defined by the quality of your question.

***""What do I do?""*** will get you general information that isn't usually actionable.

***""Is my portfolio overweight in some sectors and, if so, how should I diversify?""*** will get you useful advice you can put to work for you.

Consdidering that, if your question is still **""What do I do?"" t**hen this is exactly what you do:

Ask yourself this:

**1) Do you have any idea what you're doing?**

***""No.""***

Sell everything or buy broad, evenly weighted stock market ETFs until you know what you're doing.

***""Yes?""***

You're lying because you wouldn't have made this post if you did. You may return to this post only after you have long mused Socrates' statement, **""I am the wisest** ***man*** **alive, for I** ***know*** **one thing, and that is that I** ***know nothing***\*\*""\*\*

Then come back, sell everything or buy broad, evenly weighted stock market ETFs until you know what you're doing.

***""That's not fair!! I know I don't know what I'm doing but I still want advice so I can learn. Isn't that what this sub is for?""***

Fair enough. I'm being a grumpy old man.

Let us carry on with some helpful questions for you to answer:

**1) Are you invested in fewer than 10 companies that are almost all in the big tech sector?**

Diversify (go to Investopedia and learn what that means). Or buy ETFs.

**2) Are you invested in any company that you don't understand and/or bought a stock because some person from the internets/work/your family/your friend group/a bar (or my mom) told you that it was good?**

Go find out if that stock is actually good, bad or a memestock.

If you don't have the effort to do that, sell that stock.

**4) Do you understand that the stock market typically goes up 7-10% on average and that, currently, year-to-date it is up 23.84%,over one year it is up 43.75% and over five years it is up 153.5%?**

Whether your answer is yes or no to this question:

Consider what happens if the current growth doesn't continue or declines or goes negative.

I'm not saying they will. **I'm saying think about what that means to you if it were to happen.**

Which brings me to...

**5) Have you invested money that you can't afford to lose? Or are you trading on margin/with borrowed money?**

Don't do that.

If you can't, right now, withdraw all the money from your portfolio, set it on fire, and still be able to surivive financially without ruining your life, you need to take that money money out of the stock market.

StockMarket,DJT (Trump Media) is a Mess...,"First of all, after the drama with their audit firm BF Borgers CPA not conducting their audit correctly, it is shocking to me that the stock exchange itself has not issued a ""BC"" (below compliance) warning to investors. Serious questions linger as to the trustworthiness and reliability of previously filed financial reports for this entity.

Additionally, the capital structure and cash burn rate raises doubts about whether the company can be a ""going concern"" into the future. The company reports returns on equity and assets that are deeply negative with expenses that vastly exceed revenue. If there is any bright side, their previous financial filings indicate minimal debt and a few hundred million in unrestricted cash. The problem is that the previous financials and audit of those financials has been thrown out by the SEC, and **to date no new set of audited financials has been provided for investors.**

The company does not appear to meet even a minimum standard for listing on the major exchanges and I believe they would be right to issue a ""BC"" warning to investors and to even consider delisting this security completely due to a clear lack of reliable information for investors.

StockMarket,"Triangle Pattern Ahead of Earnings, Stock Breakout in Sight","Apple's revenue for the most recent quarter is expected to be $1.54 per share, up 5.5% from last year. As a result, investors may expect a nice trading opportunity following the report.

Apple's revenue for the most recent quarter was $85.78 billion, up 4.9% from the previous year. Earnings per share for the period came in at $1.40, which is comparable to the $1.26 per share reported in the same period last year. Compared to my forecast of $84.43 billion, disclosed revenues were 1.59% higher. eps was a surprising +4.48

Apple's consensus revenue forecast for the current quarter was $94.43 billion, up 5.5% year-over-year. The forecasts for the current and next fiscal years are $390.54 billion and $421.48 billion, respectively, representing changes of +1.9% and +7.9%.

Over the past four quarters, the company has exceeded general market expectations for earnings per share and has consistently exceeded general market expectations for revenue.

In the daily chart of AAPL stock, sustained buying pressure is questionable as prices have recently squeezed within a triangle pattern. In this case, investors may find a stabilizing trend once a proper bearish breakout of triangle support occurs.

From a broader perspective, the 200-day simple moving average is below the current Apple stock price by an even wider margin. Although a bullish crossover can be seen at the 196.29 static line, a bearish correction is waiting in the wings as mean reversion. Moreover, the 50-day SMA is closer to the triangle support level, which is a significant hurdle for sellers.

Based on this outlook, effective selling pressure stabilizing the market below the static line at 227.77 could push the price towards the 212.00 level. However, a bullish rally is possible after a bullish bounce from the 228.00 to 220.00 area. In this case, buying pressure could extend to the 260.00 to 280.00 area.",0,15,https://i.redd.it/fu8hko1fswxd1.jpeg,apple revenue recent quarter expected per share last year result investor may expect nice trading opportunity following report apple revenue recent quarter billion previous year earnings per share period came comparable per share reported period last year compared forecast billion disclosed revenue higher eps surprising apple consensus revenue forecast current quarter billion yearoveryear forecast current next fiscal year billion billion respectively representing change past four quarter company exceeded general market expectation earnings per share consistently exceeded general market expectation revenue daily chart aapl stock sustained buying pressure questionable price recently squeezed within triangle pattern case investor may find stabilizing trend proper bearish breakout triangle support occurs broader perspective day simple moving average current apple stock price even wider margin although bullish crossover seen static line bearish correction waiting wing mean reversion moreover day sma closer triangle support level significant hurdle seller based outlook effective selling pressure stabilizing market static line could push price towards level however bullish rally possible bullish bounce area case buying pressure could extend area,0.07728494623655914,Positive

StockMarket,These are the stocks on my watchlist (10/29),"

Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader.  
This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I only hold some/all MAG 7 stocks and market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions. I use IBKR TWS for my platform and charts.

I am targeting potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. This means the potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, not the business, long-term prospects, or the people involved.

PLEASE ask specific questions and PLEASE don’t ask about earnings because I typically don’t take positions before earnings announcements. Questions like “Thoughts on \_\_\_\_\_?” or “Why isn’t \_\_\_ on the watchlist?” or something answered already will be ignored unless you add detail and your opinion. If you post a question and delete it after I answer it, I will block you—doing that hurts discussion. I am not answering questions if I’m still long or short a stock beyond what I update.
